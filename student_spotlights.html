<h1 class="main-page-header" style="margin-bottom: 29px;">Daniel Invents Tools to Enable Switching Functional Groups on Peptides</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>Dr. Daniel Honeycutt recently completed his Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Rhode Island, where he trained in Professor Fang Wang’s laboratory. Originally educated as a polymer chemist, Dan pivoted into peptide science in 2020, drawn by the intellectual challenge of working with biomacromolecules whose functional groups and reactive sites present a vastly more complex landscape than traditional small molecules.</p>
<p>During his doctoral work, Dan pioneered new methods to manipulate cysteine residues—long considered one of peptide chemistry’s most versatile but also most limiting side chains. His research produced a remarkably rapid and mild bioconjugation reaction using pyridinium salts, enabling thiol labeling under physiological conditions in mere seconds. He also advanced a suite of reactions for transforming cysteine residues into β-haloalanines within unprotected peptides. These electrophilic handles open up a rich palette of downstream reactivity: direct nucleophilic substitution, transition-metal–mediated cross-coupling, and the construction of halopeptides with novel structures and properties.</p>
<p>As first author on a recent <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em> communication, Dan and colleagues introduced the concept of <em>cysteine umpolung</em>, reversing the innate nucleophilicity of the cysteine thiol into an electrophilic iodide. This “polarity inversion” unlocks late-stage peptide modifications that were previously inaccessible, providing a new chemical grammar for building molecular diversity.</p>
<p>Dan’s achievements reflect a larger vision, developing simple yet elegant solutions to complex synthetic problems in peptide science. He anticipates that halopeptide chemistry will find broad application in both discovery science and therapeutic development, expanding the toolkit for engineering biomolecules with precision. Having recently defended his dissertation, Dan looks forward to continuing a research career at the interface of organic synthesis, chemical biology, and translational medicine.</p>

<h1 class="main-page-header" style="margin-bottom: 29px;">Rachita Aims to Crack the Code of Drug Delivery</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
<p class="small">The following article was published by the Uiversity of Virgina's College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and is reprinted here by permission.</p>

<p>For Rachita Dash, a fifth-year chemistry Ph.D. at the University of Virginia, an early passion for biology sparked a journey that led her to an interest in the study of chemical biology and drug development research that could change how life-saving medicines are designed and tested.</p>
<p>"I came to a chemistry program from a more biology-focused training," said Dash, who is pursuing a doctoral degree in UVA’s Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. Attracted by the wealth of opportunities to pursue interdisciplinary research, she found a home in UVA’s Pires Laboratory where biology and chemistry merge in the service of human health.</p>
<p>Dash’s research focuses on one of the most critical and underappreciated aspects of drug development: the penetration of molecules into cells to reach their targets. Working in the lab of associate professor of chemistry Marcos Pires, she studies how structural features of molecules affect their ability to cross complex cell walls — a fundamental hurdle in the treatment of diseases like tuberculosis.</p>
<p>"In bacterial cells, for example, one of the major defenses that they have is their cell wall," Dash explained. "They are extremely elaborate; that’s especially so of the one that causes tuberculosis. It’s a very large and unique cell wall, which is one of the reasons why there aren’t a lot of antibiotics that are effective against tuberculosis."</p>
<p>Dash uses bioluminescence to track molecule accumulation inside <em>E. coli</em> cells. She also studies cyclic peptides — amino acids used in drug development — to understand how variations in their molecular structure affect their ability to pass stubborn bacterial-wall defenses.</p> 
<p>"More effort needs to be put into learning what is driving molecules through cell walls; whereas, a lot of effort has been put into how those molecules target what’s inside," she said. "It’s an area not coming to the forefront."</p>
<p>Her work in the Pires Lab, which has already produced publications that are either published or under review at leading journals in her field, aims to help scientists improve promising drug candidates before they fail in pre-clinical testing — failures that can stem from poor cellular penetration.</p>
<p>"Measuring peptide accumulation in bacteria is crucial for antibiotic discovery," Pires said. "Rachita has developed platforms to accurately measure this in difficult pathogens, aiding in optimizing drug candidates."</p>
<p>Dash’s goal is to better understand what her research group calls "the molecular grammar" that governs the penetration of molecules into cells — knowledge that can make the development of new pharmaceuticals faster and much more effective.</p>
<p>"I think this should become part of the drug exploration process," Dash said, "Not only making sure drugs are effective against their targets but also making sure that those drugs are effective at reaching those targets inside living cells."</p>
<p>Dash’s efforts recently earned her an opportunity to present her findings at the European and International Peptide Symposium in Florence, Italy. It has also earned her some of UVA’s most prestigious honors, including the Jefferson Dissertation Year Fellowship from the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, the Littleton Glover Endowed Graduate Fellowship from Arts & Sciences, and the Department of Chemistry’s Hunt Fellowship.</p>
<p>"Rachita’s research exhibits the cross-disciplinary innovation that defines our vibrant research community," said Christa Acampora, Buckner W. Clay Professor of Philosophy and dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. "Her contributions are truly impressive and push the discovery to address the world’s most pressing challenges."</p>
<p>According to Linda Columbus, UVA’s Commonwealth Professor of Chemistry, professor of molecular physiology and biological physics and chair of Arts & Sciences’ Department of Chemistry, Dash’s research represents a crucial frontier in the fight against antibiotic resistance.</p> 
<p>"Her innovative work investigating how antibiotics accumulate within bacterial cells addresses a significant challenge in infectious disease treatment — understanding why some antibiotics succeed where others fail. Working under the guidance of Dr. Marcos Pires, whose lab has pioneered creative chemical approaches to study bacterial processes, Rachita is uncovering fundamental principles that could guide the development of more effective therapeutics."</p>
<p>As she completes her final year at UVA, Dash is weighing her next steps. She hopes to continue working in drug development, wherever that may lead her.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of passion for what I do. I’ll always be curious, and I’m always looking for new ideas to explore," she said. "If you have a love for science, I think that naturally comes with it."</p>
<p>Outside the lab, Dash enjoys experimenting with Indian cooking — without the precision her research demands. When it comes to ingredients, "I never like to measure anything," she says. "I do that all day in the lab."</p>

<h1 class="main-page-header" style="margin-bottom: 29px;">Blocking Metastasis</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>Meet <b>Taylor Dill</b>, a Fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, researching in the lab of President-Elect, Eileen J. Kennedy. Her work focuses on the design and characterization of constrained peptides to disrupt key protein-protein interactions in the WASF3 protein complex, which helps regulate migration and invasion as it relates to metastatic cancers. Taylor's work aims to serve as a foundation to increase the window for cancer treatment by downregulating the metastatic burden of various cancer types.</p>

<p>In her <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/research/blocking-metastasis/" target="_blank">recent publication</a> in <em>ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters</em>, Taylor Dill and colleagues in the Kennedy Lab report the first BRK1-mimetic stapled peptides—BASH-1 and BASH-2—that directly target the WASF Regulatory Complex, WRC, a critical mediator of actin remodeling and metastasis. By designing hydrocarbon-stapled helices that mimic a hotspot within BRK1, residues 19–41, the team demonstrated potent disruption of the WRC, reducing cancer-cell migration and invasion across multiple models. BASH-2 emerged as a standout inhibitor, achieving over 90% suppression of invasion <em>in vitro</em> without cytotoxicity, confirming BRK1 as a druggable node in metastatic signaling. This work not only establishes stapled-peptide approaches as viable tools to destabilize the WRC but also advances a therapeutic strategy aimed squarely at the molecular machinery driving tumor spread.</p>

<p>Outside of research, Taylor focuses on community outreach and undergraduate mentorship within the scientific community. She aims to foster a more inclusive and diverse research environment. In the future, Taylor plans to utilize the skills and knowledge she has gained throughout her academic career to bridge the gap in health disparities prevalent among underrepresented minorities in the clinic.</p>

<div class="col-md-7">
<p>Meet <b>Thu Nguyen</b>, a Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry at New York University, conducting her research in the laboratory of Professor, and immediate Past President of APS, Paramjit Arora. Her work sits at the interface of chemistry and biology, with a particular focus on the design and synthesis of peptide-based molecules that modulate protein–protein interactions. By developing new strategies to interfere with these critical cellular processes, Thu’s research opens pathways toward innovative therapeutics for diseases that remain difficult to treat with traditional small molecules.

From left to right: Professors Jean Chmielewski and Eileen Kennedy, Doctors Emel Adaligil, James Checco, and Michael Bertucci, flanked by the 1st prize winner Thu Nguyen, NYU, and 2nd prize winner Kira Podolsky, MIT.</p>
<p>Within the Arora lab, Thu explores new methods to trap intrinsically disordered protein domains. Traditional views of the structure–function paradigm emphasize static interactions between stable protein partners. Yet many proteins operate without fixed three-dimensional structures; these intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs, engage multiple binding partners and often drive disease progression, particularly in cancer and other conditions marked by dysregulated signaling. Thu’s project envisions synthetic receptors that stabilize one of the conformations accessible to an IDP. Her approach integrates synthetic chemistry, structural biology, and biophysical methods to create molecules that bind with high affinity and selectivity, candidates that hold the potential to evolve into therapeutic leads.</p>
<p>Outside the lab, Thu enjoys hiking and camping in upstate New York, spending time with her cats, experimenting with new recipes, and connecting with friends. Now in her final year of doctoral research, Thu is preparing for the next stage of her career, whether in academia or industry, guided by her passion for science.</p>
