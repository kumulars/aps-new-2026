A Bombyx mori silk cocoon consists of two kinds of proteins namely silk fibroin
(SF) and sericin. SF is a protein biopolymer, non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable material [6]. In the present
study, we report an attempt to use SF as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the synthesis of AuNPs at normal
atmosphere under UV-B radiation environment. The formed AuNPs were characterized using different analytical
techniques like UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments.",2018,,
