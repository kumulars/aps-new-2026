            <p>The Student Activities Committee, SAC, is the heartbeat of the American Peptide Symposium's vibrant student and postdoc community. Our mission is simple but essential: to create an inclusive, energetic environment that fosters connection, collaboration, and memorable experiences for all attendees. Whether you're presenting research, making new friends, or discovering the broader peptide community, SAC is here to make your symposium experience truly exceptional.</p>

            <p>Each year, SAC is led by a small group of dedicated co-chairs and a passionate team of students and postdocs who work together to organize signature events like the Schram Young Investigator Competitions (oral and poster), the Student Mixer, and the Dr. Elizabeth Schram Networking Lunch. These events are more than just scheduled activities—they are opportunities to learn, connect, and grow as emerging members of the scientific community. Our SAC team plays an essential role in shaping these moments, offering behind-the-scenes support and warm, welcoming energy throughout the symposium.</p>

            <p>Serving on SAC is both an honor and an unforgettable experience. Members help organize judging sessions, coordinate networking activities, and ensure our student-focused events run smoothly. In return, SAC members are recognized on the APS website and at the awards ceremony—but even more importantly, they gain direct access to a powerful network of peers and professionals. If you're passionate about community, science, and making the most of your symposium journey, we invite you to join us next year and help shape the future of APS together!</p>
