Large molecules, from therapeutic proteins to diagnostic agents, cannot simply walk through. This barrier has frustrated drug developers for decades, leaving countless intracellular targets, including protein-protein interactions in the cytosol, effectively undruggable. Cell-penetrating peptides, CPPs, offer one promising solution: short sequences that ferry cargo across membranes through mechanisms still being unraveled. Yet even the best CPPs often deliver cargo inefficiently, trapping it in endosomes rather than releasing it to the cytoplasm where it can act.</p>

<p>A team led by Nobel Laureate Morten Meldal at the University of Copenhagen, published in <em>Angewandte Chemie, Int. Ed.</em>, reasoned that modifying the proline residue in cyclic CPPs could dramatically improve their penetration. Proline naturally induces β-turns, the structural kinks that help peptides interact with membranes. The researchers designed four novel derivatives of <em>trans</em>-4-hydroxy-L-proline, each bearing either an ether or secondary amine linkage to a hydrophobic group: a flat, aromatic naphth-2-ylmethylene or a flexible dodecyl chain. They incorporated these building blocks into sixteen peptide constructs, including linear sequences and three different click-cyclized scaffolds, then systematically compared their ability to enter MCF-7 breast cancer cells.</p>

</div>

<p>Flow cytometry and spinning disk confocal microscopy revealed stark differences among the variants. One cyclic peptide, cCPP 15, dramatically outperformed all others, exceeding the benchmark TAT peptide by roughly 40%. This champion sequence combines a <em>trans</em>-4-amino-L-proline modified with a naphth-2-ylmethylene group, positioned at a type II β-turn, with four D-arginine residues split between endocyclic and exocyclic positions. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the naphthalene ring embedding into the lipid bilayer while the arginine guanidinium groups coordinated with membrane phosphate headgroups. Temperature-dependence experiments and inhibitor studies pinpointed dynamin-mediated endocytosis as the dominant uptake route. The peptide accumulated progressively over twelve hours and penetrated six different cell lines, including HeLa, U2OS, and neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells, demonstrating broad applicability rather than cell-type specificity. Crucially, when the researchers conjugated an extended version of this scaffold, cCPP 18, to enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP, the construct delivered the 27 kDa protein into living cells. Neither EGFP alone nor a simple mixture of EGFP and unconjugated peptide showed any uptake.</p>

<p>The study distills several design rules for future CPP engineering. Secondary amine linkages outperform ethers. Aromatic hydrophobic groups enhance penetration more than aliphatic chains of similar length. Distributing arginine residues around the macrocycle, rather than clustering them, improves membrane interaction. These principles should guide the development of next-generation CPPs capable of shuttling proteins, nucleic acids, or small-molecule drugs past the membrane barrier. The efficiency of cCPP 15 hints at even more ambitious applications, including crossing the blood-brain barrier to reach neurological targets that remain beyond the reach of conventional therapeutics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/meldal_etal_angew_chem_dec_2025_figure.jpg,,Click-Cyclized Cell Penetrating Peptides Containing Hydrophobic Proline Derivatives for Efficient Intracellular Delivery,"Yuan Zhang, acob Kæstel-Hansen, David Teze, Ge Huang, Sanne Schoffelen, Michael Lisby, Min Zhang, Nikos S.

Their nucleophilic thiol groups react readily with electrophiles, making them popular handles for attaching drugs, fluorophores, and other payloads to proteins. Yet this reactivity creates a targeting problem: most proteins contain multiple cysteines, and standard reagents modify all accessible ones indiscriminately. A team led by Jerome Waser at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, published in <em>JACS</em>, has now solved this selectivity challenge by combining hypervalent iodine reagents with peptide-based affinity guides, achieving single-cysteine precision on a protein bearing nine reactive sites.</p>

<p>The target, the KELCH domain of KEAP1, plays a central role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. KEAP1 normally marks the transcription factor NRF2 for destruction, but when cells encounter oxidative damage, modifications to specific KEAP1 cysteines release NRF2 to activate protective genes. Among the nine free cysteines in KELCH, Cys434 sits near the pocket where NRF2 binds through a short ETGE peptide motif. The researchers recognized that peptides containing this motif could serve as molecular guides, delivering reactive cargo directly to Cys434 while ignoring the other eight cysteines scattered across the protein surface.</p>

(A) Ligand-directed site-selective protein modification; (B) peptide-directed cysteine bioconjugation; (C) modification of cysteine with EBX reagents; and (D) this work, site-selective cysteine bioconjugation with EBX reagents.</p>
</div>


<p>The team designed new ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents bearing KEAP1-binding peptides attached to the aromatic core rather than the alkyne terminus. This geometry proved essential: when the peptide binds its target pocket, the hypervalent iodine warhead points directly at Cys434. The researchers synthesized reagents carrying silylated, arylated, and alkylated alkynes, then coupled them to peptide sequences on solid phase. Treatment of KELCH with the nine-residue ligand LDEETGEFL attached to a TIPS-EBX scaffold delivered 65% conversion to the alkynylated product. A mutant protein lacking Cys434 showed zero modification, confirming exquisite site selectivity. Scrambling the peptide sequence or mutating its key acidic residues eliminated labeling entirely, proving that affinity drives the reaction.</p>

<p>The chemistry operates in two distinct modes depending on the alkyne substituent. Silylated EBX reagents act as traceless delivery vehicles: they transfer only the alkyne to cysteine while releasing the peptide ligand. This preserves the native binding surface for subsequent biological studies. In contrast, aryl and alkyl EBX reagents form stable S-vinylbenziodoxolone adducts that retain the peptide attachment. These conjugates can be cleaved later using palladium-mediated reduction, offering temporal control over ligand release. Under one set of conditions the peptide departs cleanly; under slightly modified conditions the entire modification reverses, regenerating unmodified protein.</p>

<p>The researchers demonstrated practical utility through sequential functionalization. After labeling Cys434 with an azide-bearing EBX, they clicked on a fluorescein dye via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition in a one-pot procedure. The approach tolerated complex biological mixtures remarkably well. In competition experiments with bovine serum albumin, which contains its own reactive cysteine, only KELCH underwent modification. Even in crude cell lysates containing thousands of proteins and abundant glutathione, the fluorescent signal localized specifically to KELCH.</p>

<p>This work establishes peptide-directed hypervalent iodine chemistry as a practical tool for single-site protein modification. The KEAP1-NRF2 axis represents an important therapeutic target, and the ability to install probes, drugs, or imaging agents at precisely Cys434 opens new avenues for studying and modulating this stress-response pathway. More broadly, the strategy should extend to any protein-protein interaction where a short peptide motif mediates binding, potentially bringing site-selective chemistry to targets that have resisted small-molecule approaches.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/waser_etal_jacs_nov_25_abstract_img.jpg,,Ligand-Directed Site-Selective Cysteine Bioconjugation of the KELCH Domain of KEAP1 with Hypervalent Iodine Reagents,"Christine Marty, Xinjian Ji, Stefano Nicolai, Christian Heinis, and Jerome Waser","<em>J.

This lipid anchor governs...","<p>N-myristoylation is a common posttranslational modification in which the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase, NMT, attaches a 14-carbon fatty acid to an N-terminal glycine residue. This lipid anchor governs membrane association, protein localization, and signaling cascades relevant to viral infection and cancer. While chemists have explored synthetic myristoylation to improve peptide pharmacokinetics and activity, no one had demonstrated intracellular myristoylation of a synthetic peptide: the use of cellular NMT to lipidate an exogenous substrate <em>in situ</em>.</p>

<p>A team led by Bing Xu at Brandeis University, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, now reports exactly that. The researchers designed Gbb-NBD, a short D-peptide featuring an N-terminal glycine, a dibiphenylalanine backbone for membrane affinity, and a nitrobenzofurazan fluorophore for imaging. The peptide self-assembled into nanospheres in aqueous solution and potently inhibited HeLa cell growth, GI50 approximately 500 nM, while showing minimal toxicity toward neuronal SH-SY5Y cells.</p>

<p>Live-cell imaging revealed that Gbb-NBD rapidly crossed the plasma membrane and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and mitochondria within minutes. Multiple lines of evidence confirmed intracellular myristoylation: NMT inhibitors rescued cell viability and reduced intracellular fluorescent puncta; high-resolution mass spectrometry detected myristoylated peptide in cell lysates, and click chemistry with azido myristic acid showed colocalization with the peptide. N-acetylation of the glycine abolished cytotoxicity, confirming that the free amine is essential for NMT recognition.</p>

<p>Mechanistic studies pointed to ferroptosis as the primary death pathway. The ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 rescued cells in a dose-dependent manner, immunoblotting showed depletion of the ferroptosis suppressor GPX4, and lipidomics revealed accumulation of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines, hallmarks of lipid peroxidation. Notably, cells subjected to escalating doses showed no acquired resistance, a common limitation of conventional therapies.</p>

<p>A critical control underscored the importance of <em>in situ</em> lipidation. A premyristoylated analog exhibited poor cellular uptake and weak cytotoxicity, GI50 greater than 20 μM, likely because the preinstalled lipid tail reduced solubility and eliminated the ionizable amine needed for membrane permeation. In contrast, Gbb-NBD enters cells in its more soluble, unmyristoylated form and acquires the lipid anchor intracellularly, where it drives assembly and ferroptotic signaling.</p>

<p>By co-opting the cell's own lipidation machinery, this strategy offers a new route to membrane-targeting supramolecular therapeutics. Because elevated NMT activity, which can confer resistance to NMT inhibitors, would instead amplify production of the cytotoxic lipidated peptide, the approach may prove self-reinforcing against resistant phenotypes.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xu_jacs_october_2025_fig1.jpg,,Intracellular Peptide N-Myristoylation for Cancer Cell Ferroptosis without Acquired Resistance,"Qiuxin Zhang, Weiyi Tan, Isabela Ashton-Rickardt, William Lau, Linrui Zou, and Bing Xu","<em>J.

Yet their construction remains problematic. Conventional crosslinking strategies using reagents like TBMB or TBAB often trigger unwanted side reactions with nucleophilic residues, yielding complex product mixtures and limiting throughput. More recently, bismuth-based coordination methods have shown utility in phage display, but their kinetically labile metal-peptide bonds raise stability concerns in biological environments. A truly robust bicyclization platform requires covalent bond formation, broad amino acid tolerance, and compatibility with genetically encoded library technologies.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, a research team led by Professor Xinxiang Lei at the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, China, published in <em>Angewandte Chemie International Edition</em>, developed the first photochemical bicyclization strategy using thiol-ene click chemistry. The approach employs TAIC, a water-soluble trifunctional crosslinker bearing three allyl groups, which reacts selectively with cysteine thiols under mild UV irradiation. Using lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate as photoinitiator, the reaction reaches completion within six minutes in acetonitrile-water mixtures, forming stable thioether linkages across all three cysteines. Importantly, the method tolerates every proteinogenic amino acid and proceeds efficiently on unprotected peptides, eliminating the protection-deprotection cycles that complicate conventional synthesis.</p>

<p>Optimization studies revealed that reaction efficiency depends critically on solvent composition and pH. Acetonitrile-water systems gave superior yields compared to dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, with the best results observed at 94 percent conversion using model substrates. When applied to full-length peptides containing strategically spaced cysteines, TAIC-mediated bicyclization proceeded cleanly under buffered conditions between pH 6.0 and 7.4, though higher pH values triggered competing side reactions between the crosslinker and photoinitiator. Direct comparisons with TBMB showed marked advantages: HPLC analysis of a peptide bearing multiple nucleophilic side chains revealed that photoclick bicyclization produced fewer byproducts and higher overall yields than alkylation-based methods. The substrate scope proved extensive, accommodating peptides with cysteine spacings ranging from one to eleven residues and yielding bicyclic products with isolated yields consistently above 60 percent.</p>

<p>The team then extended the strategy to phage display, engineering a peptide library on a disulfide-free pIII coat protein. After confirming that 150 micromolar TAIC and six minutes of UV exposure preserved phage infectivity, they constructed a library with approximately one billion members, each displaying a tricysteine motif flanked by randomized sequences. Panning against cyclophilin A, a validated therapeutic target involved in immune regulation and viral replication, enriched two dominant sequences after four selection rounds. The most abundant hit, designated M1, showed fivefold improved binding upon bicyclization, with the cyclic form CM1 achieving a dissociation constant of 364 nanomolar, compared to 5.09 micromolar for its linear precursor. The second hit, M2, exhibited no detectable affinity in linear form but gained submicromolar binding, 911 nanomolar, after cyclization. Plasma stability assays underscored the protective effect of bicyclization: linear M1 degraded within 30 minutes, while CM1 persisted with a half-life exceeding seven hours. NMR titration experiments using nitrogen-15 labeled cyclophilin A confirmed that CM1 binds within the catalytic pocket, inducing chemical shift perturbations in residues known to mediate substrate recognition.</p>

<p>These findings establish thiol-ene photoclick chemistry as a practical and scalable platform for bicyclic peptide discovery. By integrating rapid photochemical crosslinking with phage display, the method enables high-throughput screening of conformationally constrained libraries while maintaining the chemoselectivity and mild conditions required for biological compatibility. The submicromolar ligands identified against cyclophilin A demonstrate that photoclick-derived bicycles can achieve both high affinity and enhanced stability, addressing two persistent challenges in peptide therapeutics. Beyond cyclophilin A, this approach offers a generalizable route to targeting protein-protein interactions that resist small-molecule modulation, expanding the functional scope of genetically encoded peptide libraries and accelerating the translation of bicyclic scaffolds into drug discovery pipelines.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lei_etal_angew_chem_nov_25_fig_1.jpg,,Thiol–Ene Photoclick Chemistry for Efficient Bicyclic Peptide Synthesis and Genetically Encoded Peptide Library,"Wei Ming, Xiao-Qin Yang, Li-Wen Bai, Wei-Kang Zhai, Yi-Fei Chen, A-Li Wang, Xiaolei Wang, and Xinxiang Lei","<em>Angew.

Unlike their achiral counterparts, molecules with stereogenic sulfur centers often show improved potency and selectivity. IFM Therapeutics recently demonstrated this principle with a new NLRP3 inflammasome antagonist, the R-configured sulfonimidamide outperformed earlier achiral sulfonyl urea designs.

<p>The team discovered that a commercial, bench-stable reagent (O-(4-nitrobenzoyl)hydroxylamine) cleanly transfers a single amino group to sulfenamides under mild conditions. Initial screening of chiral bases identified tetrameric peptide guanidines as promising catalysts, though selectivity was modest. Rather than relying on trial-and-error library screening, the researchers turned to density functional theory, DFT, calculations to understand why.</p>

<p>Computational modeling revealed that the initial catalyst allowed multiple energetically similar transition states leading to opposite enantiomers. This insight suggested a clear optimization strategy, modify the catalyst to favor a single activation mode. The team introduced bulkier substituents on one arm of the peptide, which DFT predicted would create steric clashes with undesired pathways. Experiments confirmed the prediction, with selectivity improving from 65:35 to 79:21 er.</p>

<p>Further computational analysis uncovered another issue, product inhibition caused by difficult catalyst turnover. The calculations guided additional modifications at the i+3 position, ultimately identifying a phenylglycine residue that both lowered the activation energy and facilitated product release. The optimized catalyst achieved selectivities up to 99:1 er across diverse substrates, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups. A Celecoxib-derived sulfenamide converted to its sulfinamidine in 92:8 er, demonstrating the method's potential for transforming existing drugs into chiral sulfur analogs.</p>

When aberrantly activated, it drives colorectal cancer and other malignancies. Inside the nucleus, β-catenin assembles with transcription factors and the coactivator B-cell lymphoma 9, BCL9, to switch on oncogenic genes. Disrupting the β-catenin/BCL9 protein-protein interaction, PPI, offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, but the interface is large, flat, and devoid of deep pockets, making it a difficult target for conventional small molecules.</p>

</div>
<p>The researchers drew on earlier crystallographic work showing that 1:1 α/sulfonyl-γ-AApeptides adopt right-handed helices with a pitch of 5.34 Å, closely matching the 5.4 Å pitch of a natural α-helix. This structural similarity enabled straightforward mimicry of the BCL9 HD2 domain, whose hotspot residues, Arg359, Leu363, Leu366, Ile369, and Leu373, nestle into a groove on β-catenin. The team positioned hydrophobic sulfonyl-isobutyl groups and amino acid side chains at corresponding helical positions, then iteratively optimized the sequence. Fluorescence polarization assays revealed that the most potent compound, peptide 13, bound β-catenin with a dissociation constant of 40 nM, roughly 25-fold tighter than the native BCL9 peptide.</p>

<p>Circular dichroism spectra confirmed that the lead compounds adopted well-defined right-handed helical conformations in solution. Confocal microscopy showed strong cellular uptake in Wnt-hyperactive colorectal cancer cell lines at concentrations as low as 1 μM, whereas the native BCL9 peptide exhibited negligible permeability. Biotinylated analogs pulled down β-catenin from cell lysates in a dose-dependent manner, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the peptidomimetics reduced the amount of BCL9 associated with β-catenin inside cells. Quantitative PCR and RNA sequencing confirmed downregulation of Wnt target genes, including LEF1, AXIN2, and CD44. In proliferation assays, lead compounds inhibited Wnt-hyperactive cell lines with IC50 values in the low micromolar range while sparing nonmalignant cells at comparable concentrations.

This problem may intensify for some sequences bearing only a single <em>N</em>-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc, residue, the minimal glycan commonly used as a starting point for building complex <em>N</em>-glycans. Existing strategies for difficult sequences, such as removable backbone modifications or solubilizing tags, were not designed with carbohydrate chemistry in mind, and many employ harsh conditions incompatible with glycosidic bonds.</p>

<p>A team led by Suwei Dong at Peking University, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, introduces a lysine-masked GlcNAc, LMG, strategy that esterifies a protected lysine onto the 6-hydroxyl group of GlcNAc linked to asparagine or serine. The positively charged lysine tail dramatically improves solubility while remaining stable throughout standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. Mild neutral aqueous conditions, identical to those used for native chemical ligation, then hydrolyze the ester and regenerate the native sugar without additional reagents.</p>

</div>

<p>The researchers validated LMG on notoriously aggregation-prone sequences from TMEM106B, a lysosomal membrane protein implicated in neurodegeneration, and from the cancer-associated receptor MST1R. Traditional synthesis yielded insoluble gels; LMG-modified peptides dissolved readily and purified in high yield. Extending the approach to O-GlcNAc, the team prepared a serine building block and used it to access an otherwise intractable fragment of interleukin-2. LMG-bearing intermediates also proved compatible with chemoenzymatic glycan elaboration: α1,6-fucosylation and endoglycosidase-catalyzed transfer of complex sialooligosaccharides proceeded efficiently, with the lysine tag hydrolyzing <em>in situ</em> and releasing reactive substrate below its aggregation threshold.</p>

<p>The strategy culminated in a three-segment assembly of the PD-1 IgV domain bearing four site-specific N-glycans. Surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed that GlcNAc alone at Asn116 permits rapid association with PD-L1 but also fast dissociation, whereas a bulky core-fucosylated dodecasaccharide slows both processes. This trade-off between kinetic accessibility and complex stability offers fresh mechanistic insight into how glycan composition tunes immune checkpoint signaling. In sequences otherwise prone to aggregation, LMG transforms the minimally glycosylated motif into a solubilizing handle, expanding the synthetic toolkit for probing glycan function in disease-relevant proteins.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dong_chen_jacs_oct_fig.jpg,,Traceless 6-<em>O</em>-Lysyl Modification of <em>N</em>-Acetylglucosamine Enables Synthesis and Derivatization of Aggregation-Prone GlcNAcylated Peptides,"Jingnan Chen, Qikai Zhang, Rui Mo, Qi Deng, Binbin Hu, Suwei Dong","<em>J.

Lawton Endowed Professor of Chemistry,University of Washington,,Optimizing Peptide Switches,"Chemically-controlled genetic tools allow researchers to switch cellular processes on or off with small molecules, offering precise temporal and dose-dependent control.

While chemically-inducible dimerization systems are well established, their conceptual inverse, chemically-disrupted proximity, CDP, systems, remain less developed. CDP approaches pre-localize two protein partners until a drug separates them, enabling ""OFF-switch"" architectures useful for regulating signaling pathways. Yet the genetically-encoded components of existing CDP systems have not been fully optimized for intracellular performance.</p>

<p>A team led by Dustin Maly at the University of Washington, published in <em>Bioorganic & Medical Chemistry Letters</em>, tackled this gap by refining a CDP system built around the hepatitis C virus protease NS3a and its peptide partner ANR, a 21-amino-acid sequence that nestles into the protease's active site. Clinically approved antivirals such as Danoprevir and Grazoprevir can disrupt this interaction, making it bioorthogonal to mammalian cells. To identify ANR variants with stronger intracellular binding, the researchers developed a transcriptional reporter assay: ANR fused to a transcriptional activator recruits to DNA-bound NS3a, driving mCherry expression that can be quantified by flow cytometry.</p>

</div>	

<p>Using a comprehensive single-substitution library spanning all 21 ANR positions, the team sorted cells for enhanced transcriptional output across three rounds of selection. Sequencing revealed that a core of hydrophobic residues, Leu3, Leu6, Val7, Leu9, and Leu10, tolerates no substitution, anchoring ANR firmly within NS3a's binding groove. However, several peripheral positions, including Gly1, Asp4, Tyr8, and Asp16, accepted subtle, often conservative changes that boosted engagement. Combining three such substitutions, Asp4Glu, Tyr8Phe, and Asp16Asn, produced a variant achieving roughly 30-fold dynamic range between the bound and drug-disrupted states. Structural inspection suggests these gains arise from enhanced hydrogen bonding and optimized aromatic stacking with NS3a's catalytic His57.</p>

<p>When the optimized ANR was incorporated into an autoinhibited chemically-induced activator of Ras, the engineered switch displayed low basal Erk phosphorylation that rose sharply upon Danoprevir treatment. This confirms that tighter peptide–protease affinity translates directly into cleaner ON/OFF behavior in functional signaling contexts.</p>

<p>By marrying library screening with a sensitive cellular readout, this work delivers a refined toolkit for CDP-based applications, from synthetic biology switches to next-generation CAR-T ""OFF"" controls.

A modular short peptide, Py-FGGK, answers that challenge by combining three purposeful elements into a single precision construct: a pyrene-tagged fibril-forming core, Py-FFR, a gelatinase-cleavable linker, PLGVRG, and a heparan-sulfate–binding motif, KKQK.</p>

<p>Published in <em>JACS</em>, researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, IISER, in Kolkata, the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, and the S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Science, Kolkata, aim to localize at infected tissue via heparan-sulfate interactions, trigger enzymatic release at the bacterial surface, and convert that release into a lethal fibril assault on methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, MRSA.</p> 

<p>The targeting step is driven by KKQK, which binds heparan sulfate on infected tissue. Isothermal calorimetry with heparin sulfate, a validated proxy, reports a formation constant of approximately 3.08&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;M<sup>−1</sup>, providing a quantitative anchor for site localization. In serum and buffer, Py-FGGK remains colloidally stable and shows a human-serum half-life near 4.5&nbsp;h, supporting <em>in vivo</em> use.</p>

<p>Activation is delegated to gelatinase, abundant in MRSA contexts. Cleavage at the Gly-Val junction releases Py-FG, which shifts from micelles to cross-β fibrils. Pyrene serves double duty as a fluorescent reporter and a stacking promoter: excimer growth tracks aggregate formation, while microscopy confirms the morphological transition to surface-bound fibrils. Molecular simulations and spectroscopy converge on the same picture—head-on stacking by the bis-phenylalanine core, insertion at the lipid interface, and membrane thinning consistent with toroidal deformation.</p> 

<p>The antibacterial outcome is striking. Py-FGGK achieves an MIC of 1&nbsp;&micro;M against MRSA and a 10&nbsp;&micro;M MBC, with resistance pressure limited to a two-fold MIC increase over twenty passages, contrasted with a sixteen-fold rise for ciprofloxacin under the same regimen. Membrane depolarization surpasses a gramicidin control, nucleic-acid leakage increases sharply, and propidium-iodide uptake confirms dose-dependent loss of integrity. Reactive-oxygen signals rise to levels consistent with secondary oxidative stress, reinforcing the primary membrane mechanism.</p> 

<p>Biofilm defenses fare no better. Py-FGGK reduces surface hydrophobicity, suppresses staphyloxanthin that stiffens membranes and quenches ROS, curtails sliding motility, diminishes auto-aggregation, and cuts extracellular-polymer content in a clear dose response. The presence of the arginine moiety in Py-FGGK aids biofilm dispersion by enabling in situ nitric oxide, NO, production via ROS-mediated oxidation of arginine to citrulline within cells.In preformed biofilms, eradication approaches four-fifths of biomass at 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;MIC; live–dead imaging shows deep penetration with extensive mortality among matrix-embedded cells.</p> 

<p>Selectivity and safety benchmarks support translational relevance. Hemolysis remains negligible at therapeutic exposures and cytocompatibility exceeds the 70% viability bar in HEK293 and WI38 cells well above the antibacterial MIC. In fibroblast scratch assays, Py-FGGK accelerates migration, and in infected rat wounds it advances closure to roughly 90% by day&nbsp;10, with histology showing re-epithelialization, vascularization, and collagen deposition that outpace controls.</p> 

<p>The concept is elegant in its division of labor. KKQK brings the construct to the right surface, gelatinase trims the pro-peptide to an active Py-FG unit at the right moment, and the fibril-forming core executes targeted damage while sparing bystanders. The result is an enzyme-triggered, site-selective peptide therapy that couples low resistance liability with robust antibiofilm performance and tangible wound-healing benefits—an instructive blueprint for precision antimicrobials built from short, modular peptides.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/das_ghosh_jana_october_2025_fig.jpg,,Gelatinase-Responsive Short Peptide Conjugate as a Precision Therapy Against Methicillin-Resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>,"Snehanka Bose, Samya Sen, Taniya Mariyam, Aniket Jana, Nabanita Mukherjee, Uttam Pal, Batakrishna Jana, Surajit Ghosh, and Amitava Das","<em>J.

In solution, nuclear magnetic resonance revealed a decisive shift: two distinct oligomeric species, termed A and B, appeared in equal amounts, signaling the emergence of a well-defined assembly.</p>

<p>Through selective isotope labeling and multidimensional NMR, the researchers traced hydrogen-bonding and side-chain contacts that define the packing of these subunits. The data support an asymmetric hexamer built from two different trimers. Species A forms a cylindrin-like trimer with antiparallel β-strands, while species B resembles the triangular trimer seen in the crystal. The equal ratio of A and B signals, and the pattern of cross-strand nuclear Overhauser effects, confirm that the hexamer lacks symmetry and consists of intertwined A<sub3></sub3>·B<sub>3</sub> subunits.</p>

<p>Diffusion measurements show that two asymmetric hexamers associate into a dynamic dodecamer in solution. Molecular-dynamics simulations reinforce this model, preserving the asymmetric core while allowing flexible interfaces between hexamers.

Yet one residue remains notably resistant to this creativity. Arginine, which contributes nearly six percent of residues in proteins, carries a guanidinium group with high pKa and low nucleophilicity, properties that make it indispensable for molecular recognition but difficult to transform cleanly. Existing arginine-labeling reagents often generate complex mixtures, limiting their use in peptide engineering. Developing a robust approach that can target arginine directly, without collateral reactivity, remains a major challenge for chemical biology.</p>

<p>To address this gap, researchers in the Raj group at Emory University, published in <em>Organic Letters</em>, designed an acid-mediated strategy that converts arginine’s guanidinium into a stable amino pyrimidine ring. The method uses malonaldehyde to achieve selective cyclization under strong acidic conditions, producing the heteroaromatic product with near-quantitative efficiency across diverse peptide substrates. Crucially, condensation side products from nucleophilic residues such as lysine, tryptophan, or histidine can be reversed with butylamine, restoring a single arginine-derived product. This combination of chemoselectivity, reversibility, and high conversion marks a substantial advance in peptide modification.</p>
<div style=""margin: 29px"">
	<img src=""https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/raj_org_lett_oct_25_2.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1 from publication"" class=""img-responsive"">

Reversal of side products with Trp, Lys, and His is carried out by reacting with BuNH<sub>2</sub>, 75 equiv, at room temperature for 3 h.</p>	
</div>
<p>Reaction optimization revealed that malonaldehyde reacts cleanly with arginine only under highly acidic conditions. While aqueous, basic, and buffered media produced no detectable products, 12 M HCl enabled rapid and efficient conversion, reaching more than ninety-nine percent with excess malonaldehyde. The protocol tolerated a wide range of peptide sequences, including substrates containing multiple arginine residues, which were converted quantitatively to their amino pyrimidine forms. Peptides bearing other reactive residues generated predictable condensation byproducts, all removable with butylamine. Notably, in peptides lacking arginine, histidine showed only trace reactivity and cysteine remained unmodified, underscoring the method’s functional selectivity.</p>

<p>The transformation also has consequences for biological function. Cell-based permeability assays demonstrated that converting arginine to the amino pyrimidine form increased membrane uptake by approximately twofold. This enhancement likely arises from redistribution of positive charge within the heterocycle and a modest gain in hydrophobicity, properties that facilitate more efficient passage across cellular membranes. These observations suggest that the modification acts not only as a chemical handle but as a functional enhancer with direct implications for peptide delivery.</p>

<p>Beyond simple labeling, the amino pyrimidine products support late-stage diversification. Reaction with substituted 2-bromoacetophenones generated fused imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts in good yields, expanding the structural space accessible from a single arginine residue. These heteroaromatic motifs are widely used in medicinal chemistry, offering opportunities for tuning polarity, stability, and binding interactions. Because the transformation proceeds under mild conditions and preserves peptide integrity, it is well suited for modular construction of peptide-based drug candidates.</p>

<p>Together, this chemistry reframes arginine not as a difficult residue but as an entry point into heteroaromatic diversification. By enabling efficient formation of amino pyrimidines, reversible cleanup of side reactions, improved cellular permeability, and access to fused ring systems, the method broadens the functional possibilities of peptides. It offers a practical route to enhance bioavailability and pharmacological behavior while preserving the sequence-encoded specificity that makes peptides valuable therapeutic scaffolds.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/raj_group_org_lett_oct_2025.jpg,,Expanding Peptide Chemical Space via Acid-Mediated Arginine Modification,"Pinki Sihag, Minyoung Kwon, Ankita Misra, and Monika Raj","<em>Org.

Clarke, Annamaria Lilienkampf, and collaborators from the University of Edinburgh, introduce an iodo based labeling strategy that converts matrix assisted laser desorption...","<p>In work published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology,</em> David J. Clarke, Annamaria Lilienkampf, and collaborators from the University of Edinburgh, introduce an iodo based labeling strategy that converts matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry into a reliable quantitative tool for screening peptides and peptide libraries. Conventional MALDI MS suffers from heterogeneous matrix crystallization, ionization suppression, and narrow dynamic range, which makes accurate quantification difficult. Existing approaches often rely on isotope labeling with deuterium, carbon thirteen, or nitrogen fifteen or on subtle structural modifications such as methylation or glycine deletion. These methods can be costly or sequence dependent, and the resulting analyte and internal standard peaks frequently lie too close in mass for confident resolution in mixtures of related sequences. Specialized ionic liquid matrices improve spot homogeneity but require extensive optimization for each sample type and remain poorly suited for high throughput workflows. MALDI MS offers clear advantages in speed, cost, and parallelization, especially in multisample plate formats, yet its lack of quantification has limited its use in peptide library screening.</p>

<p>The authors address this limitation by tagging peptides at the N terminus with either benzoic acid or 4 iodobenozoic acid to generate pairs that differ only by a single iodine atom. Iodine provides an attractive mass defect because it exists as a single stable isotope and introduces a large negative mass offset that cleanly separates analyte and internal standard peaks in high resolution MALDI FT ICR MS. The tagging procedure is synthetically straightforward, requiring only one additional coupling step during standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. Initial validation used four short peptides designed to probe charge, hydrophobicity, and sequence variation. Calibration curves across multiple concentration ranges for each BA and IBA pair showed excellent linearity with coefficients of variation below five percent, and the method remained robust down to low micromolar concentrations. The modified matrix one methylimidazole coupled α cyano four hydroxycinnamic acid yielded uniform crystallization and reproducible ionization, outperforming conventional CHCA in spot consistency and signal stability.</p>

<p>The strategy was then evaluated with mixtures of four peptides. BA tagged analytes and IBA tagged internal standards were combined in defined ratios and analyzed by MALDI FT ICR MS. Each analyte to internal standard peak ratio tracked linearly with analyte concentration, and independent mixture sets with distinct concentration profiles were quantified with errors below five percent. These results demonstrate that the IBA approach supports accurate quantification in mixed peptide samples and preserves analyte integrity across varied sequences. To test performance in a biological context, the authors incubated peptides with fixed <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, collected the supernatants, and quantified residual peptide concentrations. Analytes with higher net positive charge, such as BA PEP01, showed strong binding to both bacteria, while neutral peptides such as BA PEP04 showed no detectable binding. Fluorescence imaging using FAM tagged analogs confirmed binding trends and validated MALDI based quantification.</p>

<p>Building on this foundation, the authors synthesized a twelve member glycine zipper peptide library using a KGLTAGLTAGL template varied at two positions. All twenty four signals corresponding to BA and IBA tagged versions appeared as distinct, resolvable peaks in the MALDI FT ICR MS spectrum. A notable example involved the M plus four isotopologue of the largest BA tagged peptide lying only 0.16 daltons from the monoisotopic peak of the smallest IBA tagged peptide, yet the iodine mass defect ensured complete separation. Calibration curves for all twelve peptides remained linear with high reproducibility. Screening the library against <em>E. coli</em> and <em>B. subtilis</em> revealed clear binding preferences. Peptides with lysine or phenylalanine at variable positions showed strong binding, while threonine or serine reduced binding. BA FK, BA LK, and BA TK exhibited complete binding to <em>B. subtilis</em> and more than fifty percent binding to <em>E. coli</em>. Fluorescence microscopy of FAM tagged peptides corroborated MALDI derived binding patterns and confirmed that sequence dependent physicochemical features, rather than antimicrobial potency, drive bacterial association in this family.</p>

<p>The authors then extended the approach to a one hundred twenty five member library incorporating noncanonical amino acids. Expansion of the glycine zipper motif allowed exploration of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and charged residues at multiple positions. Ninety nine BA and IBA pairs were detected in the MALDI FT ICR MS spectrum. Missing sequences were attributed to ionization suppression by highly charged members because undetected peptides carried net charges of minus one or zero, with only a few at plus one. Even with this spectral complexity, each resolvable BA and IBA peak pair maintained a linear peak ratio to concentration relationship. Screening against <em>E. coli</em> and <em>B. subtilis</em> produced a distribution of binding percentages from zero to sixty, and sequence analysis highlighted the importance of hydrophobic and positively charged residues in enhancing binding. A small group of peptides showed species specific preferences, such as BA Knb binding <em>B. subtilis</em> preferentially and BA Ksb showing improved binding to <em>E. coli</em>. Resynthesized peptides tagged with NBD or FAM confirmed selective labeling patterns, with NBD providing sharper discrimination due to its environmental sensitivity and minimal steric influence. Importantly, these high binders lacked strong antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations above fifty micromolar, which underscores the distinction between binding affinity and bactericidal function. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed minimal secondary structure in aqueous solution, implying that binding is driven by primary sequence properties rather than ordered amphipathic helices or β sheets.</p>

<p>Overall, this iodo based mass defect labeling strategy provides a practical and broadly applicable solution for quantitative MALDI FT ICR MS analysis of peptide libraries. The single iodine modification creates a stable internal standard with clear mass separation, enabling accurate quantification of individual peptides, mixtures, and complex libraries. The method integrates seamlessly into standard solid phase synthesis, requires no isotopic reagents, and supports parallel analysis in multiwell formats, which expands throughput while maintaining measurement precision. By enabling quantitative assessment of peptide binding to bacterial cells in solution, this approach accelerates discovery of bacteria binding peptides and offers a versatile platform for applications in diagnostics, imaging, and peptide based probe development.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure1A_revised.jpg,,Iodo-Labeling of Peptides for Quantitative MALDI MS Analysis─Screening for Bacteria-Binding Peptides from a Glycine-Zipper Library,"Liao Hu, C.

Antigen recognition depends on the three-dimensional fit of TCR, peptide, and MHC, yet predicting which peptides will bind and activate a given TCR has been difficult. In work published in <em>PNAS</em>, Visani and colleagues from the University of Washington, introduce a structure-aware machine learning approach that forecasts TCR–peptide–MHC interactions and designs new immunogenic peptides that trigger T cell responses.</p> 

<p>The method centers on HERMES, a physics-guided, 3D-equivariant model trained on diverse protein structures to infer amino acid preferences from local atomic environments. Without direct training on TCR–pMHC data, HERMES scores how well a candidate peptide fits inside a specific TCR–MHC groove. Two practical protocols are used: HERMES-fixed, which evaluates peptides on a high-quality template structure, and HERMES-relaxed, which permits local backbone and side-chain adjustments before rescoring. Together, these routes translate structural context into a single peptide energy that correlates with binding and activity.</p>

<p class=""small""><b>Figure 5. Evaluating T cell specificity from <em>de novo</em> designed peptides.</b></p>
<p class=""small""><b>A|</b> T cell specificity is measured by peptide entropy, which is computed from the HERMES-fixed predicted amino acid likelihood matrix, starting from a TCR–pMHC structural template. Each point on the plot corresponds to the entropy estimate from a distinct TCR–pMHC template, grouped by their MHC allele. The box plots display the distribution of peptide entropies for TCR–pMHC templates sharing the same MHC allele, with a white line marking the median and the box spanning the 25% to 75% quantiles. The number on the side of each box indicates the number of distinct structural templates we used for that MHC class; <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2504783122#supplementary-materials"" target=""_blank"">see SI Appendix, Table S6 for details on these structures</a>. The side plot shows peptide degeneracy for MHC presentation alone, evaluated as the entropy of the peptide position weight matrices gathered from the MHC Motif Atlas. The error bars indicate the SD of peptide degeneracies across motifs of different lengths, associated with a given MHC allele. <b>B|</b> Similar to <b>A|</b> but for degeneracy of peptides interacting with TCRs and MHCs in mice. <b>C|</b> Polar bonds, blue dashed lines, between the NY-ESO peptide, magenta, and HLA-A*02:01, gray, is shown at the Top. The additional polar bonds formed between the peptide and TRA, blue, and TRB, orange, of an interacting TCR are shown at the Bottom. These additional polar bonds limit the degeneracy of the peptides that can interact with a TCR–MHC complex compared to those presented by the same MHC.</p>
</div>

<p>Across benchmark systems, including the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 with TCR 1G4 and the viral Tax peptide with TCR A6, HERMES predictions track experimental binding affinities, Spearman correlations up to 0.72, and compare favorably with sequence-only baselines and contemporary structure-based methods. Although functional T cell readouts reflect more than affinity alone, HERMES scores still align with measured activities for multiple TCRs against cytomegalovirus and tumor epitopes, showing useful generalization when reliable structures are available.</p> 

<p>Leveraging this recognition model, the team executes <em>de novo</em> peptide design for three therapeutically relevant systems, NY-ESO, EBV, and MAGE. Designed peptides differ by as many as five substitutions from native sequences, yet activate T cells at rates up to 50% overall, with higher success, about 70%, within five-mutation neighborhoods for HERMES-fixed designs. Structure–function trends emerge cleanly, for example, glutamic acid at position 8 strengthens polar contacts to the TCR in the MAGE framework and elevates activity, while fixing critical anchor residues, such as E1 to the MHC, improves success and broadens the viable search.</p> 

<p>The study also quantifies TCR specificity by estimating the entropy of peptide preferences from template structures. Typical TCR–MHC pairs recognize on the order of 10<sup>3</sup> peptides, far fewer than the many billions that MHC molecules can present alone, highlighting how TCR contacts restrict accessible antigen shape space. AlphaFold3, AF3, templates generally preserve performance when crystal structures are unavailable, although high-quality starting models remain important for accurate ranking.</p> 

<p>Taken together, HERMES offers a practical, structure-aware path to predict TCR recognition, design immunogenic peptides, and probe TCR degeneracy. This framework can support engineered T cell therapies and peptide vaccines by nominating potent, structurally compatible epitopes, then narrowing experimental effort to the most promising candidates while guarding against off-target liabilities.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nourmohammad_pnas_october_2025_fig1.jpg,,T Cell Receptor Specificity Landscape Revealed through <em>de novo</em> Peptide Design,"Gian Marco Visani, Michael N.

Benchmarking AF2, AF2-Multimer, AF3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 on a curated, non-redundant set of 509 protein–peptide complexes confirms strong top-line accuracy—many high-quality DockQ &gt; 0.80 predictions—while exposing two central dependencies.</p>

<p>Predicted confidence, ipTM+pTM, tracks quality well, Pearson &gt; 0.7, and most high-confidence models are at least “acceptable,” DockQ &gt; 0.23. Nevertheless, all methods still produce confident false positives—poses in the wrong pocket or with flipped peptide orientation—and AF3’s edge in atomically precise cases diminishes on truly novel targets.</p>

<p>Training overlap matters. Splitting targets by training-data cutoffs reveals a marked accuracy drop for AF3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 on post-cutoff structures, whereas AF2/AF2-Multimer are less sensitive to time splits. A stricter screen that searches the training set for binding-site matches shows the same effect: interfaces represented in training are predicted substantially better. In several illustrative failures, models prefer a frequently observed “decoy” pocket from the corpus over the experimentally correct site—homology-like bias masquerading as generalization.</p>

<p>Contrary to common assumptions, inter-chain coevolution from paired protein–peptide MSAs contributes surprisingly little. Even when deeper paired MSAs are constructed by extending peptide context and then trimming back to the PDB-defined segment, shuffling the pairings barely perturbs accuracy for protein–peptide docking. For classic protein–protein benchmarks, shuffling can hurt modestly for AF2-Multimer and Boltz-1, but the effect is case-dependent. Interestingly, masking inter-chain attention in AF2-Multimer’s Evoformer degrades performance on a subset of cases, implying that the network can implicitly extract inter-chain signals even from unpaired MSAs via the interleaved row/column attention.</p>

<p>What does matter is the receptor’s unpaired MSA. The protein’s evolutionary profile drives binding-site selection, a result made vivid by ablations that remove peptide information entirely: masking the peptide as “X” leaves 40–51% of previously successful cases still successful, meaning the model can identify the pocket and approximate the bound pose without residue-level cues from the ligand. Swapping MSAs for structural templates further shows that AF2-Multimer loses more when deprived of the protein MSA than when deprived of peptide evolution, indicating that Evoformer’s processing of the receptor MSA encodes information templates alone do not replace.</p>

<p>When peptide MSAs are reasonably deep, ≥50 sequences, removing them produces a modest but consistent drop in DockQ for about one-fifth of complexes, with errors in both pocket choice and local peptide geometry. Structural templates for either partner can partially rescue performance, and AF3 in particular makes strong use of good templates when MSAs are absent. For AF2-Multimer, however, replacing the receptor MSA with a structural template is more damaging than losing the template itself, indicating that the Evoformer extracts binding-site information from the protein MSA that templates cannot substitute.</p>

<p>The broader message for peptide science and design is pragmatic. Date-based splits alone overestimate generalization; binding-site similarity filters are needed to gauge performance on truly novel interfaces. Ensuring that a high-quality target MSA <em>or</em> an appropriate structural template is available is essential. Minimal experimental priors—a pocket triad or a single restraint—can sharpen poses, but high model confidence does not guarantee correctness when targeting new sites or under-represented folds. Training-aware benchmarks reveal when a prediction is genuinely beyond the models’ comfort zone.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/keating_amy_protein_sci_nov_2025_fig_2.jpg,,Training Bias and Sequence Alignments Shape Protein-Peptide Docking by AlphaFold and Related Methods,Lindsey Guan and Amy E.

In this study, researchers in Michelle Bland's Group at the University of Virginia, published in <em>PNAS</em>, dissect how two ligands in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, brain-derived Dilp2 and fat body–derived Dilp6, respond to dietary sugar and protein and, in turn, shape third-instar physiology. Using a rigorous nutritional-geometry paradigm, 0, 1, or 10% sucrose; 0, 1, or 10% yeast extract, while precisely staging larvae with Sgs3-GFP, the authors quantify circulating peptides via tagged alleles and ELISA, and integrate endocrine readouts with trehalose, glycogen, triglyceride stores, and adult wing size as a proxy for peripheral growth.</p> 
<p>The endocrine inputs are strikingly divergent. Starvation drastically lowers hemolymph Dilp2 but leaves Dilp6 largely maintained. Sugar-only diets elevate circulating Dilp6 and drive carbohydrate and lipid storage, trehalose↑, glycogen↑, and triglyceride↑, yet fail to trigger Dilp2 release. Conversely, protein robustly restores circulating Dilp2 and rescues growth, but suppresses Dilp6. Both hormones scale with the sugar-to-protein ratio, indicating ratiometric control rather than simple on/off nutrient gating. These patterns are not secondary to ecdysteroid fluctuations at mid-L3, which remain comparable across diets.</p>

</div> 
<p>Functional genetics anchor causality. Depleting circulating Dilp6 specifically from fat body increases triglyceride stores across multiple diets and diminishes adult wing size, revealing that Dilp6 normally antagonizes fat accumulation while supporting peripheral growth late in larval life. Manipulating the single insulin receptor, InR, in distinct tissues exposes opposing systemic outcomes, overexpressing InR in fat body increases lipid storage but unexpectedly reduces wing growth, whereas fat-body InR knockdown slightly increases wing size. By contrast, cell-autonomous InR up- or down-regulation in the wing pouch respectively enlarges or shrinks wings, as anticipated. Mechanistically, fat-body InR overexpression decreases Dilp6 transcripts, while InR knockdown increases them. Together with Foxo-dependence of Dilp6 expression, this supports a feedback in which elevated local insulin signaling represses Dilp6, likely via Foxo inhibition, thereby throttling a growth-promoting endocrine cue. Sex differences are present but modest, with females showing higher circulating Dilp2 under protein-rich conditions and slightly different Dilp6 dynamics on select diets.</p> 
<p>Inter-Dilp crosstalk further refines the system: loss of Dilp2 elevates circulating Dilp6, whereas loss of Dilp6 reduces Dilp2, consistent with reciprocal regulation that differs from adult stages. Phenotypically, Dilp2 deletion yields context-dependent lipid and growth effects, including paradoxical wing-size increases under starvation, plausibly mediated by compensatory Dilp6 upregulation. Together, the data support a model in which Dilp6—induced by sugar and curtailed by protein—biases the late-larval economy to use carbohydrate for growth rather than storage as the developmental window closes, while protein-evoked Dilp2 chiefly drives growth when amino acids are abundant.</p> 
<p>This work exposes how a single insulin receptor integrates qualitatively different endocrine messages. The authors propose several, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms: ligand-biased access via binding proteins; tissue-specific receptor isoforms or coreceptors; and ligand-dependent receptor conformations that elicit distinct downstream signaling programs. By establishing nutrient-specific, hormone-specific control points upstream of InR, these findings explain how larvae couple environmental composition to anabolic decisions, and they raise broader questions about differential decoding of related ligands within ostensibly unified insulin pathways.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bland_et_al_pnas_oct_25.jpg,"<p class=""small""><b>Nutritional geometry approach.</b> <b>A|</b> Composition of standard laboratory diet and nine experimental diets varying dietary sucrose and yeast extract content. <b>B|</b> Quantity of food in gut in Sgs3-GFP larvae fed standard and experimental diets containing 1% FD&C Blue No.1 for 24 h, from ~84 to 108 h AEL, n = 4 to 11 samples/sex/diet, with 10 to 21 samples total/diet.

Because SLiM-PRD interfaces are acutely sensitive to local sequence context, single amino-acid substitutions can reconfigure interaction networks, enabling evolutionary innovation but also fostering pathogenic rewiring. Yet despite decades of progress, accurate quantitative prediction of SH2–SLiM binding affinities has remained elusive. Classical position-specific scoring matrices and modern discriminative classifiers readily identify candidate sites, but they fail to reproduce biophysically meaningful free-energy landscapes. In this context, a collaborative study from the Bussemaker and Shah Groups at Columbia University, published in <em>Protein Science</em>, establishes an integrated experimental–computational framework, built on massively diverse peptide-display libraries, multi-round affinity selection, next-generation sequencing, and the ProBound free-energy regression method, that yields quantitative, domain-specific sequence-to-affinity models capable of predicting binding free energies across the full theoretical ligand space.</p>

	<p class=""small""><b>Figure 1.</b> Overview of concerted experimental and computational strategy for generating SH2-peptide binding free energy models. <b>a|</b> Design of peptide-display libraries. <b>b|</b> Schematic showing how a randomized bacterial display library underwent repeated bead-based affinity selection for SH2 binding. In each selection round, the library was sequenced before and after selection. <b>c|</b> Overview of the regression framework used to learn energetic binding models from the sequencing data. For each possible binding site, the energy received independent additive contributions from the residues flanking the phosphorylated tyrosine, thus controlling for the binding-site context wherein the residues reside. These energy contributions were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, where the likelihood of the observed sequence counts was evaluated by first computing the total affinity for each observed sequence, controlling for multiple possible binding offsets and non-specific binding, and then computing the binomial likelihood for each round, assuming linear section. <b>d|</b> Sequence logo displaying the inferred energy contributions as letters whose height reflects the magnitude of the contributions, relative to the mean for each position. 
</div>
<p>Central to this advance is the recognition that high-throughput selection of extremely degenerate peptide libraries introduces inherent noise, bias, positional ambiguity, and non-specific carryover, especially when library designs differ in complexity and coverage. Rather than relying on naive enrichment ratios, which conflate true energetic effects with library-dependent artifacts, the authors employ ProBound to learn additive free-energy contributions directly from the multi-round selection data. By summing over all possible binding registers, controlling for non-specific selection, and maximizing the likelihood of observed sequence counts across rounds, the method deconvolves energetic preferences from the substantial experimental noise that plagues conventional enrichment-based estimates. Applied to multiple SH2 domains—including c-Src, Fyn, Grb2, Lyn, Yes, and Blk—the resulting free-energy matrices robustly capture specificity determinants from residues flanking the central phosphotyrosine, revealing the dominant energetic footprint spanning positions −2 through +3.</p> 

<p>The strategy is validated across diverse library designs, ranging from semirational pTyrVar collections to fully degenerate random libraries. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that even unbiased X11 libraries—whose naïve state is dominated by weak binders and low-frequency sequences—can be transformed into informative training data through carefully optimized multi-round selection, recovering free-energy parameters that agree closely with models derived from more constrained library formats. This universality is significant. It allows a single random library to serve as a target-agnostic substrate for profiling entirely new peptide recognition domains without relying on prior knowledge of binding motifs. Furthermore, by removing constraints on the central tyrosine and still recovering coherent binding models, the approach proves capable of discovering binding determinants without imposing motif-specific assumptions.</p> 

<p>Quantitative accuracy is established via rigorous low-throughput biophysical validation. Competitive fluorescence polarization measurements across panels of natural and engineered phosphopeptides reveal strong agreement between predicted and measured affinities, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in <em>K<sub>D</sub></em>. For Grb2, the hallmark requirement for an asparagine at +2 emerges naturally and is resolved quantitatively: peptides bearing N+2 are predicted, and observed, to bind with affinities that differ by several orders of magnitude relative to N+2 mutants. Likewise, nuanced paralog-specific preferences distinguishing c-Src and Fyn are illuminated, and structural modeling suggests that subtle divergence at a single conserved pocket residue, N201 in c-Src vs. H199 in Fyn, reshapes the electrostatics of the pY+1 binding cleft, rationalizing experimentally observed differences in affinity for glutamate, aspartate, or alanine at that position.</p> 
<p>Armed with validated affinity models, the authors extend their analysis to the human tyrosine phosphoproteome, assigning relative affinities to thousands of known phosphosites while filtering for physiologically plausible co-expression. The resulting predictions identify candidate SH2 interactors—including several not previously reported in curated interaction databases, and the model’s ability to discriminate known binding vs. non-binding phosphopeptides in external datasets further supports its generality. The framework is also applied to single-amino-acid variants from clinically relevant mutation databases; in multiple cases, predicted gains or losses of affinity align with known pathogenic signaling mechanisms, offering mechanistic insight into allelic rewiring events involving Vav2, ZAP-70, HS-1, and ARPC1B.</p> 
<p>Overall, the study demonstrates that quantitative sequence-to-affinity modeling of SH2 domains is achievable directly from high-throughput peptide display data, without requiring explicit affinity measurements. By accurately reconstructing free-energy landscapes from raw sequencing counts and capturing paralog-specific specificity determinants, this approach offers a powerful route to deciphering SLiM-mediated interaction networks at proteome scale. More broadly, it establishes a generalizable blueprint for mapping binding energetics across diverse peptide-recognition domains, moving beyond binary classifications toward predictive, energetically grounded models of cellular signaling fidelity and its perturbation by natural or disease-associated variation.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bussemaker_et_al_figure_4.jpg,"<p class=""small""><b>Figure 4.

21392,Sequence Hydrophobicity,11/11/25 16:49,Sarah L.,Perry,Professor,University of Massachusetts Amherst,,Sequence Hydrophobicity,"In this study, published in <em>Biomacromolecules</em>, researchers in Sarah Perry's group at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, employ sequence-defined polypeptides as minimal models of IDP-like LLPS, using complex coacervation...","<p>Cells routinely organize biochemical reactions within membraneless organelles formed by liquid–liquid phase separation, LLPS, where intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs, condense into dynamic, protein- and RNA-rich droplets. Dissecting how specific sequence features encode this behavior remains a central challenge. In this study, published in <em>Biomacromolecules</em>, researchers in Sarah Perry's group at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, employ sequence-defined polypeptides as minimal models of IDP-like LLPS, using complex coacervation between oppositely charged peptides to map how charge patterning and hydrophobic residues jointly tune both phase stability and viscoelastic properties.</p> 

<p>The authors synthesized families of lysine-containing cationic peptides in which the size of contiguous charged blocks, denoted by τ, was precisely controlled, and paired these with a homopolyglutamate polyanion. Coacervation was maximal near charge neutrality, and the stability of the condensed phase was quantified by salt resistance at low polymer concentrations. Increasing τ consistently elevated salt resistance, consistent with counterion-release entropy as a principal driver of complexation. Larger runs of charge confine counterions more tightly in the dispersed state; their cooperative release upon complex formation yields a greater entropic gain, stabilizing the dense phase. These results echo sequence-encoded electrostatic patterning effects that have been inferred for cellular IDPs.</p>

</div>
<p>To separate electrostatics from hydrophobic contributions, otherwise identical peptide sets were prepared in which neutral glycine was replaced by alanine. Across matched τ values, alanine-containing sequences produced coacervates that withstood higher salt, indicating an additional stabilizing contribution commonly attributed to the reorganization of water around hydrophobic side chains. In this view, the condensed phase benefits not only from counterion liberation but also from the partial release and restructuring of ordered water, broadening the two-phase region even when overall charge content is unchanged.</p> 

<p>How these sequence encodings translate into material behavior was probed by particle-tracking microrheology. For glycine-based series, viscosity rose with increasing τ, as expected for networks strengthened by longer ionic domains and more cooperative electrostatic cross-linking. In contrast, alanine-based series displayed an inverted trend in which shorter neutral blocks yielded <em>higher</em> viscosities than longer ones. Circular dichroism measurements resolved this apparent paradox: short-block alanine peptides retained pronounced polyproline II–like character within the coacervate, whereas longer blocks shifted toward mixtures suggestive of random coil and α-helix. The emergence of PPII structure correlates with increased chain stiffness and higher local charge density, both of which can raise viscosity despite identical nominal composition. Thus, secondary structure provides an additional, sequence-sensitive axis by which peptide condensates modulate mechanics, complementing electrostatics and hydrophobicity.</p> 

<p>The design space was then extended by varying neutral residue hydrophobicity (G < A < L < F) while maintaining overall chain length and introducing higher-charge motifs (K<sub>6</sub>X<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>3</sub>X). With increasing hydrophobicity, coacervates exhibited systematically greater salt resistance and dramatic viscosity gains, culminating in phenylalanine-rich systems that approached elastic-dominant behavior. The storage and loss moduli crossed over as hydrophobic content increased, indicating a transition from viscous liquid to viscoelastic gel–like response. Concomitantly, the power-law exponent from microrheology decreased with hydrophobicity, consistent with heightened heterogeneity and clustering within the dense phase. These observations align with intuitive expectations for hydrophobe-driven association, yet are now demonstrated in a sequence-controlled peptide platform rather than in random copolymers.</p> 

<p>Taken together, the work establishes clear molecular links between sequence patterning, phase stability, and rheology in peptide-based coacervates. Charge-block architecture dictates the magnitude of counterion-release entropy and thereby the robustness of phase separation to salt; hydrophobic residues add an orthogonal stabilization pathway through water-structuring effects and promote elasticity by densifying associating domains; and specific patterns can bias secondary structure formation inside the condensed phase, shifting chain stiffness and network connectivity in ways not predicted by composition alone. The net effect is a tunable palette of condensate behaviors—from fluid droplets to stiffer, more elastic materials—encoded directly in amino acid sequence.</p> 

<p>For biological condensates, these findings support a mechanistic picture in which IDP motifs leverage coupled electrostatic and hydrophobic codes, together with sequence-dependent backbone preferences, to control the balance between liquidity and solidity as function demands. For materials design, the study provides actionable rules for engineering peptide coacervates with targeted salt tolerance and mechanical response by adjusting charge-block size, neutral-residue identity, and their patterning along the chain. By marrying microrheology with controlled sequence chemistry, Perry’s team delivers a compact framework for translating molecular edits into emergent condensate function—advancing both the understanding of IDP physics and the development of programmable, biomimetic soft materials.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/perry_sarah_research_figure.jpg,"<p class=""small"">Figure 1. <b>a|</b> Schematic of oppositely charged polymers undergoing complex coacervation and releasing condensed counterions. <b>b|</b> Optical micrograph of coacervate droplets formed from poly(lysine-co-glycine, τ = 2) and poly(d,l-glutamate) prepared at 2 mM total polymer concentration and a salt concentration of 25 mM sodium chloride. <b>c|</b> Chemical structures of the peptides used in the study in increasing order of hydrophobicity (KG < KA < KL < KF).

Their study shows...","<p>Researchers from the Wang Group at the School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, China, report in <em>PNAS</em> a mechanistic bridge between two pillars of arthropod antibacterial defense. Their study shows that reactive oxygen species generated outside cells by dual oxidase 2 feed directly into the transcriptional program that drives antimicrobial peptide expression. The conduit is an aquaporin, Aqp4, identified in the red swamp crayfish <em>Procambarus clarkii</em>. Aqp4 transports extracellular hydrogen peroxide into hemocytes, where the intracellular rise in reactive oxygen species activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase, promotes nuclear translocation of FoxO, elevates Relish transcription, and increases Relish-target antimicrobial peptides. This sequence, ROS to Aqp4 to FoxO to Relish to AMPs, couples rapid oxidative killing with a longer lived peptide response and thereby strengthens and prolongs host defense.</p> 

<p>The authors first uncovered Aqp4 as a bacteria responsive factor through RNA sequencing of hemocytes and intestine after <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em> exposure, then confirmed upregulation by quantitative PCR. Functional tests using RNA interference showed that loss of Aqp4 increased pathogen load and mortality, and produced intestinal damage during infection, which places Aqp4 upstream of an effective antibacterial program. Notably, Aqp4 knockdown did not blunt the production of extracellular reactive oxygen species itself, which indicates that the aquaporin acts as a signaling gate rather than as a generator of oxidants.</p>

<p>To isolate the reactive oxygen species branch without confounding peptidoglycan signals, the team used uracil, a bacterial metabolite that selectively triggers Duox2 dependent extracellular hydrogen peroxide. Uracil raised intracellular reactive oxygen species and hydrogen peroxide in hemocytes, an effect lost when Duox2 was silenced. Blocking aquaporin function with Aqp4 knockdown or the aquaporin inhibitor TGN020 eliminated uracil driven FoxO nuclear entry and reduced FoxO binding at the Relish promoter. Quenching extracellular oxidants with ascorbate also prevented FoxO activation. These manipulations converge on a single interpretation, extracellular hydrogen peroxide enters through Aqp4, activates JNK, and enables FoxO to upregulate Relish.</p> 

<p>Linkage to effector output was established by measuring transcripts and proteins for Relish targets such as Alf3 and Eiger. Uracil induced these antimicrobial genes, while Duox2 knockdown, Aqp4 inhibition, FoxO knockdown, or Relish knockdown each reduced the response. The biology of the link proved consequential. Uracil pretreatment lowered intestinal bacterial burden and improved survival after <em>A. hydrophila</em> challenge, and this protection required Duox2, Aqp4, FoxO, and Relish. Temporal profiling highlighted why the bridge matters. Extracellular reactive oxygen species peaked early and returned to baseline within a day, yet antimicrobial peptide levels remained elevated at 24 hours, which explains the extended immune effect once signaling crosses from oxidants to gene expression.</p> 

<p>The work also clarifies pathway boundaries. Peptidoglycan, modeled with muramyl dipeptide, still drove FoxO activation without a requirement for Aqp4, which suggests parallel inputs into FoxO. By contrast, the uracil to Duox2 route strictly required Aqp4 to deliver the oxidant signal into the cytosol. The authors further showed negative control of Dilp6 is irrelevant here, and instead focused on how insulin related nodes are not central to the crayfish axis. Conservation tests in kuruma shrimp reproduced the Aqp4 dependent regulation of FoxO, Relish, and antimicrobial output, which argues that aquaporin mediated hydrogen peroxide signaling is a general arthropod solution for linking oxidative and peptide defenses.</p> 

<p>Conceptually, this study reframes the Duox2 and Relish branches as a coordinated sequence rather than isolated arms. Extracellular oxidants act as both microbicidal agents and second messengers that commit tissues to sustained peptide production once Aqp4 imports the signal. The result is more potency and longer duration for antibacterial immunity. The authors note an intriguing parallel in plants, where apoplastic oxidants generated by RBOH enzymes enter through plasma membrane intrinsic protein aquaporins to engage defense gene expression, which hints at convergent evolution for oxidant to transcription coupling across kingdoms. In arthropods, the ROS to Aqp4 to FoxO to Relish axis now provides a concrete framework to probe how immune signals traverse membranes, how tissues tune the balance between immediate oxidative attack and durable peptide based control, and how pathogens might evade both by targeting aquaporin gates.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/procambarus_clarkii_wang_group.jpg,,Linking the Production of Reactive Oxygen Species to the Expression of Antimicrobial Peptides Through Aquaporin in an Arthropod,"Zhe Wei, Ping-Ping Liu, Wei-Guang Wang, and Xian-Wei Wang","<em>PNAS</em>, <b>2025</b>, Vol. 122, No. 42",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2502570122,,,,,,,,aquaporin-bridge,11/10/25 16:22
21374,Alkyne Grasp,11/10/25 15:52,Takahashi,Fujishiro,Professor,"Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University",,Alkyne Grasp,"ATP-grasp ligases offer a powerful route to diversify peptide structures, and BesA stands out for its ability to incorporate terminal alkyne groups into dipeptides with high specificity. By dissecting BesA’s catalytic mechanism and engineering substrate tolerance...","<p>BesA is an ATP-grasp ligase that stitches <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-propargylglycine to <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-glutamate at the γ-position, furnishing γ-<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-glutamyl-<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-propargylglycine, a compact alkyne handle ideal for azide–alkyne cycloaddition. In a study published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, researchers in the Fujishiro Lab at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Japan, defines how BesA selects and positions a terminal alkyne and shows how that recognition can be repurposed to build non-natural alkyne dipeptides for click chemistry. Crystallography at 3.6 Å revealed the typical ATP-grasp fold with A, B, C, and N domains forming an ATP cavity and a narrow adjoining cleft for the amino acids. Although ATP hydrolyzed under acidic crystallization and only adenine was observed, superposition with AMP-bound ATP-grasp homologs allowed a reliable model of the nucleotide pose. Docking γ-Glu-Pra into an ADP-loaded model placed the Pra alkyne in a tight hydrophobic pocket lined by Tyr33, Ala34, and Met37, while Arg50, Arg365, and Arg404 shaped a cationic corridor for the glutamate carboxylates. The geometry positions the Pra terminal C–H toward the Tyr33 ring, consistent with stabilizing CH–π contact as the dominant alkyne recognition force, with possible minor π–π contribution.</p>

<p>Mutational kinetics support this picture. Wild type showed KM(<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Pra) ≈ 0.53 mM and kcat ≈ 92 min<sup>-1</sup>, in line with earlier reports. Replacing Tyr33 with Ala raised KM(<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Pra) about twenty-fold while preserving a relatively high kcat, which indicates Tyr33 governs Pra binding rather than the rate-limiting chemistry. Arg50A and Arg404A also weakened Pra binding, while Arg365A had little effect on Pra KM, which matches its distance from the alkyne in the model. Substrate handling for <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Glu differs. Wild type exhibited KM(<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Glu) ≈ 3.1 mM, the highest among tested variants, and Arg50A lowered KM(<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Glu) markedly, likely by relieving steric clash and easing entry of the γ-carboxyl toward ATP. KM(ATP) values were uniformly low, with Arg365A showing the largest increase, consistent with a role near the γ-phosphate in the ATP-bound state rather than in ADP accommodation.</p>

</div>	

<p>With this structural and kinetic map in hand, the authors probed substrate scope. Only one glutamate analog, 1-methy<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-glutamate, served as an acceptor, and only with the Arg50A variant, yielding 1-methy<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-Glu-Pra at a slower rate than γ-Glu-Pra. Other analogs failed, which underscores the importance of positioning the γ-carboxyl for phosphorylation and the tight dimensional limits of the pocket. On the donor side, the enzyme accepted <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-homopropargylglycine. Docking predicted that the longer alkyne still nests against Tyr33, although the terminal C–H aligns less directly. Experiments confirmed formation of γ-Glu-homoPra by wild type with a kcat only about two-fold lower than for Pra, and a higher KM that reflects looser binding. Carbon-13 labeling placed the ligation at the glutamate γ-carboxyl, the same regioselectivity observed for Pra. Variants largely lost activity with homoPra, which again highlights the fine fit around Tyr33.</p>

<p>These data motivate a stepwise catalytic sequence. ATP–Mg<sup>2+</sup> binds first and is anchored by conserved polar and hydrophobic contacts in the A/B domains. Pra enters next and is captured by the Tyr33 pocket, which keeps the alkyne aligned without covalent capture. Glutamate then binds adjacent to ATP and Pra. The enzyme phosphorylates the γ-carboxyl of glutamate. The Pra amine attacks the activated carbonyl to form the γ-peptidyl linkage and release phosphate. The low KM for Pra relative to glutamate likely reflects a biological strategy in the β-ethynylserine pathway: BesA sequesters a potentially toxic Pra intermediate that can inhibit PLP enzymes, and channels it promptly into a ligated product.</p>

<p>The Tyr-centered CH–π clamp explains several comparative observations across alkyne-binding proteins. PLP enzymes inhibited by Pra lack an equivalent aromatic cradle, or they position Tyr for irreversible chemistry, which would be incompatible with catalysis in BesA. PutA’s preference for an alkyne over an alkene is also congruent with Tyr-mediated stabilization of a linear π system that presents a polarized terminal C–H. The model further rationalizes why <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-cysteine, but not <span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-methionine, can masquerade as Pra in earlier screens. A sulfur–π interaction with Tyr33 is plausible for cysteine, while methionine is too bulky for the pocket.</p>

<p>From an applied view, BesA is already a competent biocatalyst for installing compact alkynes into dipeptides under mild conditions. Acceptance of homoPra points to routes for cel<span style=""font-size: .8em;"">L</span>-friendly labeling since homoPra is a known methionine surrogate in translation systems. The Arg50 position emerges as a gatekeeper for the acceptor side. Substitutions that open space near the glutamate channel, combined with Tyr33 conservation for alkyne capture, should enable engineering toward bulkier or modified γ-carboxylate partners. The kinetic partitioning suggests that improving binding, not turnover chemistry, will drive gains in catalytic efficiency. Directed evolution focused on the B/N-loop cleft, with selections that reward γ-selective phosphorylation and retention of the alkyne CH–π geometry, is a logical next step.</p>

<p>In sum, BesA recognizes terminal alkynes through a defined Tyr33 pocket and couples that recognition to ATP-powered γ-peptide bond formation. The work provides a mechanistic foundation for tailoring BesA as a click-ready peptide ligase, expands the chemical space to include homoPra-bearing products, and clarifies how a single aromatic residue can translate a minimalist functional group into precise enzymatic selectivity.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fujishiro_group_acschembiol_fig_two.jpg,,Mechanism and Utility of the ATP-Grasp Enzyme BesA for the Synthesis of Non-natural Alkyne-Containing Dipeptides Applicable for Click Chemistry,Hono Otsuka and Takashi Fujishiro,"<em>ACS.

Dickey, Otto, and collaborators at the National Institutes of Health, now report in <em>Nature Communications</em> an entirely new AMP family, termed the transmembrane helix–containing bacteriocins, TMcins, that defies long-held assumptions about peptide pore formation. In contrast to classical AMPs that transiently disturb membranes or large protein toxins that assemble stable channels, TMcins achieve both feats within a single short peptide: they oligomerize into discrete, nanometer-scale β-barrel pores stabilized by transmembrane helices.</p> 

<p>The discovery originated from an unusual cluster of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> isolates, CT545, recovered from Buruli ulcer wounds that displayed potent diffusible antimicrobial activity absent in closely related strains. Genomic sleuthing revealed a small plasmid, pCT545, carrying a previously unrecognized biosynthetic gene cluster, BGC whose deletion abolished activity. Complementation restored killing, proving that pCT545 encodes a new ribosomally synthesized AMP. Purification and sequencing identified a 5.8 kDa peptide, TMcin, processed from a 297-bp precursor and secreted via an associated ABC transporter system. Bioinformatic analyses showed that TMcin escaped all current AMP-prediction pipelines, highlighting the limitations of purely computational discovery.</p>

</div>

<p>Structural modeling by AlphaFold2 predicted a remarkable architecture: an N-terminal transmembrane α-helix capped by a pair of conserved tryptophans and tethered to a C-terminal two-strand β-sheet loop closed by disulfide bonds. The fold exposes a hydrophilic β-sheet face alongside a hydrophobic helical belt, endowing the peptide with an overall amphipathic character. TMcin homologs carrying this distinctive motif were subsequently identified across multiple Gram-positive genera, including <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>Actinomyces</em>, indicating a broad evolutionary distribution of the family.</p> 

<p>Functionally, TMcin-G1905 exhibited potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive pathogens—methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>, and others—while sparing Gram-negative species, whose outer membranes likely block access. Microscopy and biochemical assays revealed that TMcin associates with cellular membranes, triggers ATP leakage, and dissipates membrane potential without lysing cells outright. The resulting shrunken, depolarized phenotype is consistent with sustained pore formation rather than wholesale membrane dissolution.</p> 

<p>Electrophysiology confirmed this mechanistic leap. In planar lipid bilayers, purified TMcin-G1905 produced stepwise current jumps with median conductance of 10.8 nS in 150 mM KCl—orders of magnitude greater than canonical AMP channels such as gramicidin A. The pores displayed linear current–voltage relationships and negligible ion selectivity, signifying large aqueous conduits. AlphaFold2 multimer modeling and microsecond molecular-dynamics simulations converged on stable ring-like assemblies of roughly twenty peptides forming a β-barrel inner wall encircled by a hydrophobic helix belt. Hydrogen bonding and inter-strand salt bridges knit the oligomer together, while simulations in cardiolipin-containing bilayers demonstrated long-lived structural integrity. Circular-dichroism spectra supported mixed α/β content in solution, matching computational predictions.</p> 

<p>Functionally, these pores are massive: <em>S. aureus</em> cells exposed to TMcin became permeable to 40 kDa fluorescent dextran and polysucrose probes, confirming translocation channels up to ~10 nm in diameter, comparable to classical protein toxins yet built from a 5.8 kDa peptide. The study further uncovered a natural partnership between TMcin and the staphylococcal surfactant peptides, phenol-soluble modulins, PSMs. PSMs enhanced TMcin solubility and diffusion, acting as molecular chaperones that release the hydrophobic AMP from producer membranes, an elegant co-evolutionary adaptation within the same bacterial species.</p> 

<p>Beyond its microbiological novelty, TMcin reshapes our understanding of AMP structure–function space. It bridges the conceptual divide between disordered, transiently permeabilizing peptides and structured, protein-scale pore-formers, establishing a continuum of membrane-active architectures. The TMcin BGC represents a new ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide, RiPP, family, previously hidden from genome-mining algorithms due to its unusual sequence and domain composition. Its discovery suggests that additional, unrecognized AMP classes remain embedded within microbial genomes, awaiting phenotype-driven approaches for identification.</p> 

<p>By coupling genomics, structural modeling, electrophysiology, and microscopy, Dickey and colleagues reveal an AMP that functions as a true nanoscale pore-forming complex. The implications are profound: TMcins provide a new mechanistic template for engineering stable β-barrel pores from short peptides, opening avenues for synthetic antimicrobial design, biosensing, and controlled molecular transport. At a broader level, they underscore the evolutionary ingenuity of bacterial defense systems and expand the molecular repertoire available to counter antimicrobial resistance.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nature_comm_august_2025_otto.jpg,"<p class=""small""><b>Fig. 1: Discovery of a novel bacteriocin AMP and BGC</b></p> <p class=""small""><b>a|</b> Antimicrobial activity indicated by a zone of clearance is restricted to the CT545 <em>S. aureus</em> cluster.

Mucins, the glycoprotein constituents of mucus, achieve their viscoelasticity through peptide backbones enriched in proline, threonine, and serine interlaced with complex glycans. Mimicking this dual peptide-glycan architecture has proven difficult, yet essential for probing mucus functions in health and disease. Recent strategies have employed the α-helical coiled-coil scaffold hFF03 as a modular hydrogelator. Researchers in the Koksch Group at the Freie Universität Berlin, published in <em>Peptide Science</em>, systematically introduce histidine residues and monosaccharides into hFF03 to evaluate how glycosylation and divalent metal coordination shape peptide structure, rheology, and morphology.</p>

<p>The 26-residue hFF03 scaffold was diversified by substituting Lys at position 4, 25, or both with His, thereby creating accessible imidazole ligands for metal binding. In parallel, mannose or galactose was conjugated at Lys18 via a glutaric anhydride linker. The resulting library encompassed twelve (glyco)peptides, including His-free controls. Circular dichroism, CD, oscillatory rheology, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy, cryo-TEM, were employed to assess conformational and viscoelastic consequences of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition under physiological pH and temperature.</p>
<div style=""margin: 29px;"">

</div>
<p>CD analysis revealed that metal-free glycopeptides largely preserved higher-order structures characteristic of hFF03. However, incorporation of His introduced metal sensitivity. Position was decisive: His at residue 4 maintained robust higher-order structure but adopted more α-helical character upon Cu<sup>2+</sup> addition. His at residue 25 yielded atypical CD signatures, including non-assignable spectra with Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting local distortion or C-terminal imidazole–carboxylate interactions. Double substitution, K4H/K25H, produced pH-sensitive peptides prone to precipitation above pH 7.4, yet demonstrated marked metal-dependent conformational switching. Glycan identity further modulated these behaviors, with galactose often favoring helical stabilization compared to mannose.</p>
<p>Viscoelastic profiling uncovered a delicate interplay between histidine placement, glycan identity, and metal coordination. <em>His at position 4:</em> hydrogels retained stiffness comparable to hFF03; mannosylation softened gels, while galactosylation stiffened them. Cu<sup>2+</sup> generally reduced storage modulus, G′, though Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Gal combinations could increase rigidity. <em>His at position 25:</em> substitution alone markedly weakened hydrogels, ~80% reduction in G′. Yet, glycosylation reversed this trend: hFF-K25H-GA-Gal displayed the highest stiffness across the library, particularly with Cu<sup>2+</sup>, highlighting cooperative influence from glycan hydroxyl coordination. <em>Double His substitution:</em> despite expectations of cumulative coordination, K4H/K25H variants did not universally stiffen gels; effects were glycan- and metal-specific. Notably, glycosylated disubstituted peptides showed net stiffening upon metal addition, whereas aglycons softened.</p>
<p>Cryo-TEM underscored these rheological findings. hFF-K25H-GA-Gal formed long, slender fibrils in the absence of metal but collapsed into dense fiber bundles upon Cu<sup>2+</sup> addition. Dark electron-dense spots along the bundles suggested localized Cu<sup>2+</sup> clusters cross-linking individual fibrils, consistent with heightened viscoelasticity. By contrast, His4 variants displayed no morphological response to copper, affirming residue position as a key determinant.</p>
<p>Hydrogel mechanics can be tuned with remarkable sensitivity by triadic interplay among histidine location, glycan identity, and divalent metal ions. While His25 alone compromises gel strength, His25 coupled with galactose and Cu<sup>2+</sup> yields the stiffest hydrogels, mimicking the responsiveness of native mucins to trace metal concentrations. These findings establish design rules for biomimetic glycopeptide hydrogels and highlight the potential of combining site-specific glycosylation with pH-switchable histidine coordination to engineer adaptive, stimulus-responsive materials.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/koksch_group_figure.jpg,,Metal Ion–Induced Cross-Linking in Mucin-Inspired Peptide Hydrogels,"Annelie Puhlmann, Cihan Baydaroglu, Boris Schade, Michael Gradzielski, and Beate Koksch","<em>Peptide Science</em>, <b>2025</b>, Volume 31, Issue 11",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psc.70059,"<p><b>Annelie Puhlmann</b> is a second-year PhD candidate in the laboratory of Professor Beate Koksch at the Department of Chemistry of the Freie Universität Berlin.

The central innovation is the development of unsaturated phosphine oxides that can be modularly derivatized via CuI-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC, producing diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides, DTPOs, and ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides, EDPOs, with distinct reactivities and applications.</p>

<p>DTPOs act as highly efficient reagents for antibody disulfide rebridging, enabling homogeneous conjugates with rapid kinetics and superior stability. When applied to trastuzumab, only five equivalents of DTPO were sufficient to achieve complete rebridging within two hours, outperforming earlier diethynyl-phosphinate reagents that required overnight reactions. The resulting conjugates retained antigen selectivity and serum stability, and functionalization with tetrazine handles permitted modular payload attachment through inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder, IEDDA, chemistry. This two-step route produced a DAR ~4 trastuzumab–MMAE ADC with potent cytotoxicity against Her2-positive cells while sparing antigen-negative lines. The use of tetrazine/TCO intermediates ensures versatility across payload classes and minimizes direct handling of cytotoxic species.</p>

<p>Parallel to antibody modification, EDPOs emerged from double CuAAC functionalization of triethynyl-phosphine oxide. These reagents uniquely combine peptide cyclization with installation of a cysteine-reactive handle, allowing one-pot peptide macrocyclization and subsequent protein conjugation. Using azide-functionalized peptides, the authors synthesized cyclic electrophilic ligands—such as integrin-binding RGD motifs and polyarginine-based cell-penetrating peptides—that were then conjugated to proteins like mCherry. The resulting peptide–protein hybrids displayed efficient intracellular delivery, especially when combined with cell-penetrating peptide additives, underscoring the utility of this chemistry for live-cell applications.</p>
<p>Overall, the work establishes unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive scaffolds for bioconjugation. DTPOs provide fast, selective, and stable antibody rebridging, supporting modular ADC construction, while EDPOs introduce a unique single-reagent cyclization–bioconjugation platform for peptide–protein conjugates. These advances significantly expand the chemical biology toolkit, offering modular and orthogonal approaches for precise biomolecule functionalization.

Efforts to develop synthetic catalysts have often attempted to mimic these features by organizing multiple reactive groups on molecular scaffolds. Previous work showed that a simple seven-membered ring hydrazide catalyzes aldol condensations of aldehydes. An apparent second-order kinetic dependence on the hydrazide was observed, suggesting a bifunctional mechanism involving simultaneous iminium and enamine activation of aldehyde substrates by hydrazide units. Flexible dihydrazides composed of two hydrazide units connected with a 10-methylene linker provided enhanced rates relative to a monohydrazide, underscoring the value of covalently linking two hydrazide groups for cooperative catalysis.</p>

</div>
<p>Seeking to understand the relative kinetic benefits of reactive unit connection and preorganization, researchers from the Gellman Lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison investigated α/β-peptide foldamers containing a preorganized hydrazide diad. Their report was published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>. The α/β-peptide scaffold, featuring a 1:2 α:β residue pattern and helical conformation, was hypothesized to align hydrazide units in the i,i+3 spacing along one side of the helix. This design was expected to restrict conformational freedom and favor cooperative bifunctional catalysis by preorganizing the hydrazide units next to one another.</p>

<p>An α/β-peptide heptamer catalyst, containing two glutamic acid residues connected to hydrazide groups in the i,i+3 spacing, exhibited significant activity in the homoaldol condensation of hydrocinnamaldehyde, achieving nearly quantitative product yield after 1 h and a ν<sub>REL</sub> of 89 compared to a simple monohydrazide. Variants containing hydrazide-displaying residues with shorter or longer side chains showed reduced activity, indicating there was an optimal spacing between the reactive hydrazide groups. Comparisons with flexible dihydrazides revealed that the α/β-peptide heptamer dihydrazide conferred a 2.5- to 3.5-fold enhancement in initial reaction rate, a modest improvement relative to expectations based on the conformational preorganization offered by the peptides. Structural analysis yielded the first crystal structures of catalytically active α/β-peptides that showed consistent helical backbones but variable side chain orientations, highlighting that the α/β-peptide heptamer catalysts could closely arrange the hydrazide units while still allowing for appreciable flexibility.</p>

<p>This work demonstrates that α/β-peptide foldamer catalysts can preorganize a catalytic diad and provide measurable rate enhancements over catalysts with simple flexible linkers. However, the modest magnitude of improvement suggests that simple covalent connection between reactive groups delivers much of the available benefit, and that enzyme-like rate acceleration likely requires additional contributions such as substrate desolvation or multipoint interactions. These findings provide a foundation for future exploration of foldamer-based catalytic scaffolds.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gellman_jacs_sept_2025.jpg,,Bifunctional Catalysis of Aldol Reactions by Foldamer Dihydrazides: Assessment of Conformational Preorganization,"Philip P.

21247,Ephemeral Pores,10/11/25 16:28,Richard W.,Pastor,Professor,National Institutes of Health,,Ephemeral Pores,"In a <em>PNAS</em> study, researchers from the Pastor group at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Cotten group at Oregon State University present a combined experimental/simulation framework using the AMP piscidin-1...","<p>Membrane-active peptides, MAPs, span two archetypes: antimicrobial peptides, AMPs, which transiently porate membranes and kill cells, and cell-penetrating peptides, CPPs, which cross bilayers with little overt permeabilization to deliver cargo intracellularly. Despite decades of study, the structural basis of their hallmark transient leakage—rapid dye efflux that self-terminates and can be reinitiated by adding more peptide—has remained elusive. The central obstacle is that leakage depends not only on peptide sequence and dose but also on bilayer composition, curvature stresses, and kinetic pathways that are inherently nonequilibrium. In a <em>PNAS</em> study, researchers from the Pastor group at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Cotten group at Oregon State University present a combined experimental/simulation framework using the AMP piscidin-1, P1 that establishes a single quantitative mechanism linking graded and all-or-none release via asymmetry-driven poration.</p>
<p>When cationic amphipathic peptides first bind the outer leaflet of a vesicle, they create leaflet area asymmetry and surface-pressure imbalance. This “area stress” lowers the free-energy cost of forming transient pores. Two poration pathways relieve the stress: 1| CPP-like pores—narrow, short-lived defects that permit lipid and peptide flip-flop with negligible solute loss, “none” in all-or-none, and 2| fully hydrated metastable pores—larger defects that rapidly leak dye before closing. The observed leakage mode is not binary, it reflects the competition between these pathways, governed by lipid composition, local peptide concentration, and the evolving free-energy landscape as asymmetry is dissipated.</p>
<p>Start–stop dye-release assays on LUVs show that P1 causes a burst of leakage that levels off within ~1 h and restarts upon re-addition, consistent with a self-limiting, stress-relaxation process. Crucially, lipid composition alone toggles the apparent mode: in 3:1 POPC:POPG, P1 yields graded leakage; adding lysophosphatidylcholine to make 2:1:1 POPC:POPG:lysoPC shifts behavior to predominantly all-or-none. Kinetically, lysoPC accelerates efflux: at L/P ≈ 60, the first-burst rate is ~3.3-fold higher, ≈2.7×10<sup>-1</sup> vs 8.1×10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. Fluorescence requenching curves capture these regimes: monotonic increases in the graded system, and flat or nonmonotonic responses in lysoPC membranes indicative of all-or-none. These data argue that packing defects and positive spontaneous curvature, introduced by lysoPC, favor formation and persistence of larger pores.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics with potentials of mean force, PMFs, compare area-stressed, AS, bilayers with all peptides on one leaflet, for example, 10/0, ten on one leaflet, none in the other, to area-relaxed, AR, with peptides symmetrically distributed as in 5/5, five in each leaflet. Area stress dramatically reduces the barriers for water-wire initiation, CPP-like pore formation, and pore expansion. For example, in AS 10/0 membranes the free energy to form a 10 Å radius pore is ~12.4 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup>, versus ~22.7 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> in AR 5/5, an ~10.3 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> stabilization that explains rapid, stress-driven poration. LysoPC further lowers barriers: water-wire, CPP-like, and 10 Å pore formation are each ~2–8 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> easier than in lysoPC-free POPC:POPG at the same peptide asymmetry. Only AS systems exhibit plateaus/local minima in the PMF at small radii, consistent with metastable pores; AR systems show no such minima, and pores close swiftly.</p>
<p>Unbiased simulations starting from pre-formed pores confirm these energetics. In AS bilayers, fully hydrated pores often persist for microseconds, accompanied by rapid lipid translocation, ≈10–12 net flips within hundreds of nanoseconds, and occasional peptide translocation, both hallmarks of asymmetry relaxation. In AR membranes, the same pores collapse within tens to hundreds of nanoseconds with negligible lipid movement. Mechanistically, peptides in AS systems tilt and insert more deeply, termini crossing the midplane, as pores nucleate and grow, reducing overcrowding in the outer leaflet and stabilizing the defect; this deep insertion is rare in AR controls.</p>
<p>Because peptide distributions are inhomogeneous on vesicle surfaces, local microdomains experience different effective concentrations and defect propensities. The authors formalize this by allowing two functions of peptide: 1| the probability that a vesicle leaks, reflecting the fraction of domains that enter the hydrated-pore pathway, and 2| the average fractional release from leaking vesicles, reflecting pore size/lifetime. With these two sigmoidal controls, a single model recapitulates ideal graded, increasing requenching signal, ideal all-or-none, flat, and nonmonotonic mixed behavior, rising at low dose, flattening/decreasing at higher dose. Fitted to the P1 data, the unified model yields better goodness-of-fit than classical graded or all-or-none models while remaining mechanistically interpretable in terms of pore energetics and domain heterogeneity.</p>
<p>The framework elevates membrane context to a first-class design parameter: lipids that introduce positive curvature and packing defects, for example, lysoPC, lower line tension and raise pore lifetimes/radii, biasing toward all-or-none. Conversely, compositions with fewer defects and more negative curvature bias toward small, rapidly closing pores and graded release. Peptide variables—charge, amphipathicity, hydrophobic moment, and insertion propensity—shift the same landscape. Practically, one can 1| tune selectivity by matching sequence features to the defect spectrum of target membranes, 2| exploit stapling/oligomerization tendencies that raise local surface concentration and favor hydrated pores in desired contexts, and 3| integrate requenching kinetics with potency/cytotoxicity readouts to map sequence–mechanism–activity relationships. Because the model is quantitative and rooted in PMFs, it provides a clear path to in silico screening or machine-learning surrogates informed by measurable parameters, EC<sub>50</sub>, burst rates, requenching curves.
<p>Transient poration by MAPs emerges from a single, asymmetry-driven mechanism in which area stress lowers pore-formation barriers, two pore classes compete to relax stress, and leakage terminates once asymmetry dissipates. Lipid composition, defects, curvature, peptide distribution, local crowding, and sequence-encoded insertion dynamics jointly set pore probability, size, and lifetime, thereby spanning the full continuum from graded to all-or-none release. This unified view turns long-standing phenomenology into predictive design rules for AMPs and CPPs, enabling rational targeting of membranes with enhanced cellular specificity.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pastor_et-al_piscidin_figure.jpg,,A Unified Model of Transient Poration Induced by Antimicrobial Peptides,"Amy Rice, Andriana C.

<p>Mechanistically, a tethered-iodoaryl phosphoramidite 1 cleanly phosphitylates Ser to phosphite 3 with 5-methyl-tetrazole. Under 390 nm light irradiation, a strongly reducing photocatalyst, E* ≈ −2.5 V vs SCE, reduces 3 to an aryl radical that cyclizes into phosphorus; β-scission then cleaves the Ser C–O bond, generating an α-alanyl carbon radical. That radical engages Giese additions to many acceptors and is terminated by hydrogen atom transfer from IDM-BH<sub>3</sub>, validated by exclusive D-incorporation when IDM-BD<sub>3</sub> is used. Oxygen suppresses the reaction; light and photocatalyst are required; Stern–Volmer data identify the Ser-phosphite as the primary quencher. Importantly, chiral HPLC shows no α-epimerization—this is stereoretentive at α-C. A small competing path to dehydroalanine is observed but manageable.</p>

<p>Scope is conspicuously broad for a late-stage peptide method. Electron-poor alkenes, vinyl nitriles, acrylamides, acrylates, vinyl phosphates, acrylic acid, give homologated side chains such as homoglutamine and homoglutamic acid; vinyl pyridine and α,α-disubstituted alkenes are tolerated; vinyl boranes can be funneled to 5-hydroxynorvaline after oxidation. Even strained or less activated partners, [1.1.1]propellane and phenylacetylene via downstream arylation, participate. The platform also enables direct installation of affinity/fluorophore handles, either by using prefunctionalized acrylates, biotin, or by clicking downstream on an introduced handle, for example, turning an acrylate adduct into a fluorescent probe.</p>

<p>Selectivity is a highlight. In head-to-head competition, Ser is phosphitylated approximately four times faster than Thr; Tyr and Lys do accept phosphorylation but their intermediates do not undergo the deoxygenative coupling and simply hydrolyze back, restoring the native residues; Cys is not phosphitylated and does not interfere with the photo reaction. That orthogonality lets the chemistry run cleanly in unprotected, polar peptide settings.</p>

<p>The method works both on solid support and in solution. On-resin, a TBS-protected Ser is unveiled and immediately taken through activation and coupling to give, for example, a diethyl phosphate–modified Ser in an overall 32% isolated yield from resin across a standard SPPS sequence. In solution, the same transformation proceeds in comparable overall efficiency, for example, 38% from the isolated peptide, with partial conversion at the phosphorylation. Swapping the alkene for IDM-BD<sub>3</sub> with no acceptor provides Ser→Ala-3-d<sub>1</sub>, useful for pharmacokinetic probes or radiotracer analog development.</p>

<p>Compatibility is evidenced across pharmacologically and biologically relevant peptides: enkephalin, bradykinin, and α-MSH are all modified cleanly at Ser. An atosiban analog is accessed by intramolecular capture, N-terminal acrylate, to induce macrocyclization, illustrating on-peptide conformational editing. Across these examples, hydrophilic (Arg, His, Lys, Glu, Thr, Asn) and hydrophobic (Gly, Val, Ile, Met, Phe, Pro, Tyr, Trp, Cys) side chains are tolerated without bespoke protection.</p>

<p>The significance is twofold. First, it finally enables late-stage Ser editing by C–C bond formation under conditions that respect native peptide complexity—ideal for SAR libraries and medicinal chemistry across lead peptides, macrocycles, and probes. Second, it introduces an orthogonal, modular entry to noncanonical residue space from a native amino acid, with stereochemical fidelity and programmable handles. Practical considerations remain, photoredox setup; exclusion of O<sub>2</sub>; managing minor Dha formation; phosphorylation efficiency in highly polar sequences, but the operational simplicity, chemoselectivity, and breadth make this a workhorse method for peptide diversification and tool compound assembly.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/diao_jacs_aug_25_fig_1.jpg,,Late-Stage Serine Modification Enables Noncanonical Peptide Synthesis,Zhenyan Guo and Tianning Diao,"<em>J.

The inner mitochondrial membrane is a particularly challenging barrier due to its dense protein composition and strong negative electrochemical potential.

<p>In work published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, Adeline Schmitt, under the guidance of Helma Wennemers at ETH Zürich, investigated rigid polyproline II, PPII, helical scaffolds containing guanidinium-proline, Gup, residues patterned with hydrophobic groups to tune amphipathicity and uptake. They synthesized amphipathic nonapeptides of general sequence (XZZ)<sub>3</sub>, Z = Gup, where X was valine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, or cyclohexylalanine, Cha. Circular dichroism confirmed stable PPII helices with aligned hydrophobic and cationic edges. Cellular uptake in MCF-7 cells revealed that only the Cha-containing peptide achieved mitochondrial localization, while others remained cytosolic or nucleolar, whereas Arg-substituted controls lacking helicity failed to reach mitochondria, underscoring the importance of both secondary structure and hydrophobicity.</p>

<p>Hydrophobicity tuning further refined targeting. Adding a Cha residue at the C-terminus significantly increased uptake and mitochondrial colocalization, even in shorter 7-mer analogs. Introducing (4S)-cyclohexyl-proline, ChPro, directly into the backbone produced even more hydrophobic peptides. These variants showed higher uptake and faster membrane association, with some transitioning into mitochondria after 24 h; however, excessive hydrophobicity led to endosomal trapping, strong membrane binding, and cytotoxicity at micromolar levels.</p>

<p>Flow cytometry quantified these effects, showing up to 10-fold improvements in uptake upon Cha or ChPro substitution, while confocal microscopy clarified that high uptake often reflected membrane accumulation rather than true mitochondrial entry.

<p>This work defines design rules for mitochondria-targeting CPPs: a rigid PPII backbone with guanidinium groups aligned on two edges and hydrophobic residues on the third edge enables selective uptake. Subtle increases in hydrophobicity—particularly at the C-terminus—enhance mitochondrial localization, though excessive hydrophobicity promotes off-target accumulation and toxicity. Importantly, intracellular redistribution over time proves critical, suggesting that both sequence design and temporal dynamics determine organelle selectivity.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wennemers_acs_chem_biol_october_25.jpg,,Amphipathic Proline-Rich Cell Penetrating Peptides for Targeting Mitochondria,Adeline Schmitt and Helma Wennemers,"<em>ACS Chem.

21230,Copper Clicks,10/10/25 15:06,Norman,Metanis,Professor,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,Copper Clicks,"In a collaborative work between the Metanis and Shimon labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Wang group at the Xiamen University in China, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, a copper-mediated approach is introduced...","<p>Site-specific peptide and protein bioconjugation under physiological, aqueous conditions remains a central challenge due to the dense array of competing nucleophiles and acids/bases presented in biomacromolecules. Among existing strategies, methods targeting cysteine, Cys, and selenocysteine, Sec, have become increasingly attractive because of their high nucleophilicity and low natural abundance. Yet, many strategies still require prefunctionalization of either the residue, for example, TNP activation of Sec, or the payload, for example, hydrazines, complicating workflows and risking off-target reactivity. In a collaborative work between the Metanis and Shimon labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Wang group at the Xiamen University in China, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, a copper-mediated approach is introduced that directly couples electron-rich arene C–H bonds to free S/Se–H in Cys/Sec under mild, biocompatible conditions, eliminating preinstallation steps and broadening payload scope to complex natural products and drugs. The chemistry proceeds rapidly, shows useful Sec-over-Cys selectivity that can be tuned by arene electronics, tolerates diverse sequences, and extends to peptide stapling/cross-linking and protein-level modification.</p>
<p>Initial screening with a Sec-containing model peptide, LGUALG-NH<sub>2</sub>; isolated as diselenide, identified Cu(OTf)<sub>2</sub> as an efficient promoter of direct aryl–Se bond formation with resorcinol, 2a, in neutral buffer at 37 °C, delivering 93% conjugation in just 15 min. 1D/2D NMR assigned substitution at C-4 of resorcinol to give the primary monosubstituted adduct; at higher peptide loadings, di- and trisubstitution appeared, foreshadowing applications in stapling/cross-linking. Translating the conditions to a Cys analogue, LGCALG-NH<sub>2</sub>, provided a single monosubstituted product, 89% in 1 h, establishing parallel reactivity across chalcogen homologues.</p>
<p>Systematic variation revealed broad compatibility with resorcinol derivatives, 3b–3f, and heteroarenes including pyrroles, indoles, quinolinediol, coumarin, and pyridine. Strong electron-donating groups increased rates/yields for both Sec and Cys; in several Sec cases, disubstitution was observed, whereas Cys remained strictly monosubstituted under standard conditions—an exploitable difference for sequential chemistry. Less activated arenes, phenol, or 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, were inert, underscoring the need for sufficient π-donation to enter the catalytic manifold. Notably, m-phenylenediamine showed poor reactivity toward Cys despite its basicity, emphasizing that aromatic electronics, not simple nucleophilicity, govern productive coupling.</p>
<p>The method directly appends resveratrol, genistein, serotonin, β-carboline, harmol, vancomycin, phentolamine, and biotin, via phloroglucinol relay, to Sec-peptides with generally high conversions; serotonin and resveratrol also conjugate efficiently to Cys. This immediate access to peptide–drug conjugates, PDCs, avoids protecting-group gymnastics and enables straightforward diversification with pharmacophores spanning polyphenols, alkaloids, glycopeptides, and affinity tags.</p>
<p>Control peptides lacking Sec/Cys, but containing Tyr/Trp, were inert, confirming functional-group selectivity in complex sequences. MS/MS localized modification to the targeted thiol/selenol. Local environment strongly modulates outcome: Sec/Cys at termini or in open, sterically accessible contexts can yield di-adducts, two peptides per arene, whereas buried residues favored mono-adducts. This stereoelectronic sensitivity enables programmed outcomes, mono versus cross-link, by sequence design and positioning.</p>
<p>Using phloroglucinol, 2e, as a trifunctional hub, the team achieved high-yield stapling across Sec–Sec, 90%, Cys–Cys, 89%, with ~25% oxidized +32 Da species, and Sec–Cys, 94%, pairs in designed peptides, with tryptic mapping confirming exclusive chalcogen conjugation. Beyond intramolecular stapling, a one-pot, stepwise “Se-aryl–S” strategy cross-linked distinct peptides: first form a Cys–aryl adduct, then introduce a Sec-peptide plus fresh copper to complete intermolecular bridges. Purifying the intermediate improves final conversion, for example, 90% vs 67% for a representative pair, providing a tunable route to heterodimeric constructs. Importantly, ICP-MS of purified products showed <1 ppm residual Cu, supporting downstream biological use.</p>
<p>Chemically synthesized ubiquitin, (2–76)(Q2U) and Q2C variants, expressed ubiquitin(1–76)(M1S, Q2C), and Z_HER2 affibodies bearing terminal Sec or Cys were successfully modified. Highlights include 93% Sec–serotonin conjugation in 3 h, with minor deselenization over prolonged basic conditions, and ~79% Sec–vancomycin in 10 h; Cys variants gave 50–70% conversions in matched conditions, while WT controls lacking Sec/Cys were unreactive. These results demonstrate selective, functional labeling on folded proteins, extending the peptide-phase reactivity rules to macromolecular contexts of therapeutic interest, for example, HER2-binding affibodies.</p>
<p>Radical scavengers, TEMPO, DMPO, BHT, DPE, did not inhibit under standard aqueous conditions; however, EPR detected an aryl carbon-centered radical in the presence of Cu(II) and phloroglucinol, which was quenched by Sec/Cys peptides but not Ala. DFT supports a proton-coupled electron transfer, PCET, from the electron-rich arene to a Sec-peptide–Cu(II) complex, forming Cu(I)–Sec and an aryl radical (Ar•) that associates with Cu(I); spin delocalization onto Cu explains weak radical capture by traps. The concerted Se–Se homolysis / Se–C bond formation via the lowest barrier transition state proceeds with a ΔG‡ ≈ 19.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and an overall exergonicity by ≈ 9.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, consistent with room-temperature kinetics. Alternate copper pathways modeled after other C–H activation proposals were less favorable. Cys follows an analogous route, with productive reactivity observed even from disulfide dimers under inert atmosphere, further aligning with the Sec mechanism.</p>
<p>This direct, copper-mediated arylation of free Cys/Sec furnishes a general, chemoselective, and biocompatible entry to peptide/protein conjugates without payload or residue prefunctionalization. The platform unifies: I. broad payload scope, natural products, drugs, tags; II. sequence-aware control over mono- vs di-substitution; III. efficient stapling/cross-linking architectures; and IV. protein-level labeling with sub-ppm metal residues. Mechanistic convergence on PCET-initiated, copper-bound aryl radicals provides levers—arene electronics, copper ligation, microenvironment sterics—to refine selectivity and rate.</p>
<p>Immediate applications include rapid assembly of PDCs, affinity/fluorophore tagging, and topology control, staples, heterodimers, in discovery workflows. Looking forward, tailoring arene electronics and ligand fields to bias Sec over Cys, or vice versa, minimizing oxidative byproducts in Cys stapling, and integrating biorthogonal handles could expand precision. The approach’s simplicity — through C–H to S/Se–H coupling in buffer — positions it as a practical workhorse for programmable bioconjugation in complex biological settings.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/metanis_et_al_jacs_august_2025.jpg,,Late-Stage Aromatic C–H Bond Functionalization for Cysteine/Selenocysteine Bioconjugation,"Zhenguang Zhao, Jian Huang, Yao Cai, Tai-Ping Zhou, Fatina Khatib, Daphna Shimon, Binju Wang, and Norman Metanis","<em>J.

Natural proteases govern countless biological processes, yet their lack of...","<p>Precise external regulation of enzymatic activity remains a central goal in chemical biology, with wide-ranging implications for biotechnology, diagnostics, and medicine. Natural proteases govern countless biological processes, yet their lack of spatiotemporal control limits their direct application in engineered systems. Conventional strategies for modulating proteolysis, such as pH, temperature, or chemical effectors, offer little precision, and systemic protease inhibition carries a high risk of off-target toxicity. Light, by contrast, provides non-invasive, reversible, and highly localized control, making it an ideal external trigger for catalytic regulation.</p>
<p>Building upon this principle, researchers from the Bandyopadhyay Group at the Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, IISER, in Kolkata, India, published in <em>Angewandte Chemie International Edition</em>, have developed a small-molecule light-activated peptidase, SLAP, that functions as an enzyme mimic. The design integrates three critical components: 1| a glucose unit to provide hydrogen-bonding and transition-state stabilization, 2| an imidazole residue to serve as a general base, and 3| an azobenzene photoswitch that dynamically modulates the spatial relationship between these catalytic elements. Upon photoisomerization, the system undergoes a dramatic change in activity, enabling light-gated proteolysis of small molecules, peptides, and cellular proteins.</p>
<p>The SLAP catalyst is inspired by natural proteases like papain and trypsin, wherein catalysis relies on the proximity between a nucleophilic residue, serine or cysteine, and a general base, histidine. In SLAP-switch-1, the primary hydroxyl group of glucose substitutes as the nucleophile, while the imidazole moiety provides base activation. These two components are tethered by a bifunctional azobenzene linker, whose <em>trans</em> state holds them ~14 Å apart, inactive, and whose <em>cis</em> state contracts this distance to ~1.8 Å, active.This structural rearrangement establishes short hydrogen bonds, &lt;2.5 Å, essential for catalytic efficiency. Beyond mere positioning, the glucose unit also offers a substrate-binding handle through multiple hydrogen bonds and contributes to transition-state stabilization. Such fine molecular engineering echoes Feringa’s vision of artificial molecular machines, where motion and catalysis are coupled through photonic energy inputs.</p>
<p>Spectroscopic studies confirmed robust and reversible photoswitching. The trans isomer exhibited characteristic π–π*, 319 nm, and n–π*, 430 nm, absorption bands, which shifted upon UV, 366 nm, irradiation to yield a cis-enriched photostationary state, ~62% <em>cis</em>. Blue light, 466 nm, reversed the process, regenerating the <em>trans</em> state,  &gt;90%.</p>
<p>Importantly, SLAP-switch-1 displayed fatigue resistance over multiple irradiation cycles, with no significant degradation across ten switching events. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the <em>cis</em> isomer possesses an unusually long half-life, ~74 days at room temperature, attributed to stabilizing intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This ensures both durability and practicality for repeated light-controlled catalysis.</p>
<p>The catalytic capacity of SLAP-switch-1 was first evaluated with p-nitroacetanilide, PNA, as a model substrate. In the presence of the <em>cis</em> isomer, UV–vis monitoring revealed rapid disappearance of the 315 nm absorption band, substrate, and emergence of a 385 nm band, product, p-nitroaniline. The <em>cis</em> isomer achieved a ~300-fold enhancement in hydrolytic rate relative to the <em>trans</em> state or catalyst-free controls, underscoring the profound influence of spatial proximity on activity.</p>
<p>Subsequent assays with a FRET-based peptide substrate bearing a tryptophan as a fluorophore and a DNP unit as a quencher, DNP-PLGMWSR, provided further evidence for the efficacy of the SLAP switch as a peptidase. Michaelis–Menten analysis yielded k<sub>cat</sub> = 1.94 min<sup>-1</sup>, K<sub>M</sub> = 0.12 mM, and a catalytic proficiency, k<sub>cat</sub>/k<sub>uncat</sub>, of ~10<sup>3</sup>, values notable for a small-molecule mimic. LC–MS analysis confirmed the release of amino acid fragments, validating true peptide bond hydrolysis. Crucially, catalytic activity was shown to be reversibly switchable: alternating cycles of UV and visible light toggled the system between active and inactive states, enabling repeated on–off regulation of proteolysis.</p>
<p>To prove biological relevance, SLAP-switch-1 was introduced into HEK-293 cells, focusing on microtubule integrity as a readout. Confocal microscopy revealed significant loss of microtubule staining in <em>cis</em>-treated samples, while <em>trans</em>-treated and control cells retained intact cytoskeletons. Western blotting corroborated these findings, showing marked reduction of tubulin protein levels only under <em>cis</em> activation.
<p>These results demonstrate that the catalyst functions not only <em>in vitro</em> but also within cellular contexts, achieving light-regulated proteolysis of structural proteins under physiological conditions. While the system is not inherently selective for tubulin, its proof-of-concept activity against a well-defined cytoskeletal target highlights the feasibility of extending small-molecule enzyme mimics into living systems.</p>
<p>The development of SLAP-switch-1 marks a significant advance in the field of artificial enzyme mimics. Unlike earlier catalytic antibodies or cyclodextrin-based systems, this design achieves high catalytic efficiency, broad substrate scope, and reversible regulation through a simple photoswitchable triad.</p> 
<p>The implications span multiple domains. In basic science, light-gated peptidase mimics provide new tools for dissecting protein function with temporal and spatial precision. In biomedicine, they suggest future opportunities in targeted protein degradation, particularly in contexts such as tumor microenvironments or neurodegenerative protein aggregation, where conventional protease activity is either insufficient or deleterious. Finally, in bioengineering, such systems may serve as modular components for synthetic biology, drug delivery, or programmable biomaterials.</p>
<p>Challenges remain, notably the lack of intrinsic substrate specificity and the reliance on UV light, which can damage cells. Future efforts will focus on engineering variants responsive to near-infrared irradiation, compatible with deep-tissue applications, and on refining scaffold design to enhance selectivity toward disease-relevant targets. By uniting the principles of photochromism, proximity control, and transition-state stabilization, SLAP-switch-1 achieves light-controlled peptidase activity with remarkable efficiency. This artificial enzyme mimic represents a step toward programmable proteolysis, demonstrating the power of molecular design to replicate, and in key respects, surpass the regulatory sophistication of natural enzymes.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bandyopadhyay_angew_chem_image.jpg,,A Photoregulated Peptidase Mimic,"Monochura Saha, Palash Jana, and Subhajit Bandyopadhyay","<em>Angew.

Yet, they have remained largely outside the reach of structure-based design. Standard modeling tools, for example, Rosetta, do not natively understand lanthionine/methyllanthionine rings or dehydrated residues, dehydroalanine, dehydrobutyrine, blocking predictive modeling and rational engineering. Researchers in the Walker and Meiler Groups at Vanderbilt University, published in <em>Protein Science</em>, remove that roadblock by parameterizing these chemistries in Rosetta and demonstrating that ensemble-based refinement against NMR data captures the intrinsic flexibility of lanthipeptides while maintaining experimental agreement and improving energetic quality. The result is a practical platform for lanthipeptide prediction and design.</p>
<p>Two capabilities were added to Rosetta. First, bonded parameters for thioether crosslinks were introduced: C–S bond distance, two adjacent angles, and three dihedrals for lanthionine; for methyllanthionine, additional angle terms and an improper dihedral maintain methyl geometry. Torsional terms draw from Amber protein side-chain potentials, with bond/angle terms using Rosetta’s Cartesian energy. Second, backbone conformational statistics for dehydrated residues were calculated by DFT-based φ/ψ scans, (M05-2X/6-311G(d,p)), yielding new Ramachandran tables that reflect the sp<sup>2</sup> α-carbon and, for dehydrobutyrine, restricted regions to avoid γ-sterics.</p>
<p>Structure prediction then proceeds by generating conformational ensembles that are scored by Rosetta energy and fit to NMR NOE restraints in an ensemble-averaged sense, in essence, the ensemble collectively satisfies distances, no single member must meet all. This is crucial: enforcing per-structure satisfaction often optimizes towards a single conformation, averaging exposes multiple low-energy states that are altogether consistent with experimental data.</p>
<p>Across ten PDB entries, helical and non-helical, Rosetta ensembles refined with NOEs show:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Similar agreement to experimental NOE data compared to deposited NMR ensembles,</p></li>
<li><p>Lower Rosetta energies, often improved fa_atr, fa_rep, fa_sol, fa_elec, rama_prepro, and</p></li>
<li><p>Greater conformational breadth, higher intra-ensemble backbone RMSD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a control, selecting 20 low-energy, NOE-consistent Rosetta structures without explicit ensemble-averaging still improved energies versus PDB, but full ensemble averaging produced the lowest energies and broadest yet data-consistent flexibility. These trends suggest the deposited ensembles may underestimate true flexibility, and that the Rosetta ensembles map lower free-energy basins compatible with NMR data.</p>
<p>Helical lanthipeptides benefit from AlphaFold2 as a starting backbone, for helicity only, after which lanthionine formation, dehydration, and conformational sampling in Rosetta refine the models. A consistent pattern emerges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rings embedded in helices are locally rigid, ring RMSD typically ≤1 Å vs PDB,</p></li>
<li><p>Global variability concentrates in tails and inter-helix linkers, frequently enriched in glycine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Representative cases highlight this division of labor: glycine-rich segments, for example, GLGV motifs, serve as hinges; adjacent rings at termini perturb helical packing; and ring-mediated contacts modulate inter-helix orientation. Notably, allowing two alternative nonhelical “bites” in a glycine-rich stretch can reconcile NOE contacts with helical chemical-shift predictions, underscoring the value of ensembles for resolving apparently conflicting data modalities.</p>
<p>Non-helical lanthipeptides require broader sampling: randomized φ/ψ guided by the Ramachandran potential,iterative ring closure, and relaxation. Here, ring–ring orientation and uncyclized segments dominate flexibility. Even when individual rings are moderately rigid, relative ring orientations vary by 2–8 Å backbone RMSD vs PDB. Where rings lack internal hydrogen bonds and include glycine, Rosetta finds multiple low-energy ring conformers, with the largest, H-bond-poor, Gly-rich macrocycles showing the greatest ring RMSD. Conversely, regions densely cyclized, overlapping/nested rings, are locally more rigid, yet global rigidity is not guaranteed: cyclization reduces but does not eliminate conformational freedom.</p>
<p>For peptides with overlapping rings, Rosetta sampling uncovers non-interconverting atropisomers, kinetically trapped arrangements. Pre-selection filters these when they conflict with experimental restraints; the PDB-major isomer typically dominates the candidate pool. Recognizing atropisomerism is essential when interpreting NMR for nested/overlapping macrocycles.</p>
<p>Three design-relevant determinants recur:</p>

<p>Two bottlenecks remain for truly <em>de novo</em> prediction: 1| current pipelines assume known ring topology and stereochemistry; these depend on enzyme–substrate pairing and are not yet predictable from sequence alone, and 2| widely used chemical-shift tools, for example, TALOS-N, SHIFTX2, do not handle noncanonical residues, limiting orthogonal restraints.

Finally, AlphaFold’s helicity cues are helpful but not decisive; ring patterns incompatible with helices should route models to the non-helical pipeline.</p>
<p>With lanthionine and dehydration chemistries now native to Rosetta, lanthipeptide design can move beyond brute-force library screens. The demonstrated ensemble-centric refinement provides realistic, low-energy structural hypotheses that 1| explain disparate NMR observables, 2| reveal motion hotspots for engineering, for example, rigidify a linker, introduce an intra-ring H-bond, replace Gly, and 3| guide screen construction or hit optimization for antibiotic and targeting applications.</p>
<p>Encoding lanthionine crosslinks and dehydrated residues in Rosetta, combined with ensemble-averaged NMR restraint fitting, yields experiment-consistent, lower-energy, and more flexible models than deposited NMR ensembles. The picture that emerges is of dynamically adaptive macrocycles: rings can enforce local order, but global behavior is set by where and how those rings are placed, what residues they contain, and how they interact. This capability turns lanthipeptides into first-class citizens of structure-based design, enabling hypothesis-driven engineering of macrocyclic antibiotics and beyond.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/walker_meiler_tydings_research_image.jpg,"<p class=""small"">Lanthipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. <b>a|</b> Lanthipeptides contain a leader peptide for enzymatic recognition and a core peptide that is modified.

These compounds exploit electrophilic warheads to irreversibly or reversibly engage nucleophilic residues, most often cysteine. Despite advantages in potency and pharmacodynamics, covalent inhibitors are limited by toxicity and off-target promiscuity, creating demand for new chemistries and high-throughput methods to generate selective libraries.</p>

<p class=""small"">The Bode Group at ETH Zürich.</p>
<p>Motivated by this gap, researchers in the Bode Group at ETH Zürich, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, developed a streamlined workflow for postassembly modification of peptide acyl hydrazides, enabling site-specific installation of electrophilic warheads. Using automated liquid handling and solid-phase ion exchange purification, synthetic peptides were converted directly into warhead-bearing inhibitors without laborious chromatographic purification. This platform produced 88 peptide-derived probes in 96-well format, incorporating warheads spanning chloroacetamides, Michael acceptors, alkynes, and nitriles.</p>

<p>As a test case, inhibitors were designed against cathepsin S, Cat S, a cysteine protease implicated in cancer and autoimmune disease. Peptides derived from selective fluorogenic substrates were synthesized and modified with electrophiles. Screening revealed that truncated peptides bearing chloroacetyl warheads displayed nanomolar inhibition of Cat S, with potency gains of up to three orders of magnitude compared to acetylated controls. IC<sub>50</sub> determinations and kinetic analysis confirmed strong covalent engagement with catalytic cysteine residues.</p>

<p>Chemoproteomic profiling, however, uncovered unexpected off-target activity. Biotinylated chloroacetyl probes strongly labeled protein disulfide isomerase A1, PDIA1, and related isomerases in lysates, consistent with their high cysteine content and abundance in the endoplasmic reticulum. Control experiments confirmed that linker and biotin elements contributed significantly to this off-target effect. These findings highlight both the utility and the pitfalls of reactive electrophiles in chemoproteomic probe design.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates a robust, automated platform for rapid covalent inhibitor library generation. The approach accelerates discovery of selective inhibitors while also revealing liabilities, particularly unintended PDIA1 engagement. The results underscore the need for careful warhead selection and off-target characterization in covalent drug discovery.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bode_et_al_acs_chem_biol_august_2025.jpg,,Chemoselective Installation of Electrophilic Warheads onto C-Terminal Peptide Hydrazides for Covalent Protease Inhibitor Synthesis,"Shaun O’Hare, Kateryna A.

In a study published in <em>Biochemistry</em>, researchers in the Legleiter lab at the University of Nevada at Reno, examine four spike-derived peptides, s192, s258, s601, and s1166, under carefully controlled, seed-free conditions to map their aggregation kinetics, catalogue oligomer and fibril morphologies, and determine how those species engage model brain-lipid bilayers. Together, the data show that aggregate behavior is not a simple function of hydropathy or net charge but instead reflects a nuanced interplay among sequence patterning, aggregation rate, and the chemistry and mechanics of the surface the peptides encounter.</p>
<p>Peptide stocks were HFIP-treated to erase pre-existing seeds, reconstituted, and diluted into TRIS/NaCl buffer at 50 μM, with aggregation followed by ThT fluorescence at 37 °C. Early and late time points were visualized by AFM on mica to quantify oligomer heights, diameters, and volumes, and to define fibril architectures. To probe membrane effects, the authors combined ThT assays in the presence of total brain lipid extract, TBLE, vesicles with in situ AFM on supported TBLE bilayers, imaging the same patch of membrane over time, both without and with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is known to stiffen anionic membranes by tightening headgroup packing. As a counterpoint to hydrophilic headgroup surfaces, <em>in situ</em> AFM on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, HOPG, assessed interactions with a hydrophobic substrate.</p>
<p>All four peptides formed ThT-positive amyloid, but with distinct kinetic fingerprints: s1166 and s601 nucleated rapidly, s258 showed intermediate behavior, and s192 aggregated most slowly. AFM revealed correspondingly diverse oligomer populations and fibril morphologies. s192 produced a broad continuum of oligomers that matured into long, ~5–7 nm-high fibrils; s258 yielded two discrete oligomer classes that later gave thin, highly branched, laterally associating fibrils; s601 displayed early protofibrils consistent with fast nucleation and then two fibril families, raft-like ~1.5 nm structures and thicker 5.5–8 nm branched fibers, and s1166 produced sparse, small oligomers early and abundant fibrils later, with clear evidence of twisting and thick–thin interconversion. The presence of TBLE vesicles modestly delayed fibrillization for s192, s258, and s601 but not s1166, and DLS showed no vesicle fusion or flocculation, indicating that bulk lipid does not catastrophically remodel under these conditions.</p>
<p>Strikingly, only s192 robustly engaged and damaged supported TBLE bilayers. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, s192 oligomers appeared within minutes, accumulated in number, and grew in height and lateral extent while the membrane roughened and disrupted over large areas. Adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> tempered this behavior, reducing both the fraction of the surface affected and the roughness amplitude, consistent with cation-induced bilayer stiffening that raises the energetic barrier to insertion and in-plane growth. The other peptides were far less injurious: s258 and s1166 formed stable ""carpets"" of oligomers that neither grew appreciably nor measurably roughened the bilayer, and s601 deposited only transient, sparse oligomers with negligible coverage. Notably, all four peptides readily adsorbed to HOPG and often grew in place, underscoring how hydrophobic interfaces favor capture and expansion even when hydrophilic, anionic membranes do not.</p>
<p>These observations argue for a three-part mechanism. First, electrostatics and mechanics at the membrane surface gate initial capture: anionic headgroups disfavor net-negative species, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> further tightens packing to resist insertion across the board. Second, sequence patterning—how polar and hydrophobic residues are distributed along the chain—matters more than overall GRAVY score: s192, although comparatively hydrophilic and net positive, appears ""tuned"" for bilayer engagement and on-surface oligomer growth, whereas more hydrophobic peptides fail to transition from surface contact to disruptive insertion. Third, aggregation state shapes toxicity windows: rapidly nucleating systems, such as s601 and s1166, may sequester into solution-phase assemblies that are less compatible with membrane insertion, while slowly nucleating s192 retains a population of surface-competent oligomers that can grow <em>in situ</em> and roughen the bilayer.</p>
<p>Methodologically, the work cautions against using bulk ThT alone to infer biological risk. Interfacial assays reveal phenotypes—stable oligomer carpets, on-surface growth, roughening without fusion that are invisible to solution kinetics yet likely decisive for cellular outcomes. Biologically, the results refine mechanistic hypotheses for post-acute sequelae: even if only a subset of spike fragments directly damages membranes, the broader ensemble of oligomers and fibrils could still perturb proteostasis, synaptic adhesion, endothelial integrity, or cross-seed host amyloids, offering multiple routes to persistent dysfunction. The limitations are clear—TBLE is a surrogate membrane lacking cell-type specificity and proteins, AFM time windows are finite, and concentrations may not mirror tissue microenvironments—but the framework is powerful. Immediate next steps include mapping sequence determinants for on-membrane growth, quantifying conductance changes to link roughening to permeability, varying lipid composition and cholesterol to mirror neuronal and endothelial membranes, and testing cross-seeding with Aβ, α-synuclein, and tau to connect these phenotypes to known disease pathways.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/legleiter_etal_jacs_sep_25.jpg,,Amyloidogenic SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Derived Peptides Form Oligomers and Selectively Damage Lipid Membranes,"Anjola Adewoye, Ephraim Ezeigbo, Quan H.

This immunosuppression is driven in large part by the RGD-binding integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8, which are upregulated across many solid tumors. Direct systemic blockade of TGF-β has proven toxic, and broad integrin inhibition risks off-target liabilities,such as bleeding events via αIIbβ3 inhibition. Conventional peptide scaffolds also struggle with <em>in vivo</em> stability and manufacturability.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, researchers from San Diego-based <a href=""https://www.lassogen.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lassogen</a>, whose mission is to unlock the therapeutic potential of engineered Lassotides™, reports in <em>JACS</em> the use of lasso peptides with a rigid loop-over-ring topology as a scaffold for dual, selective inhibition of αvβ6 and αvβ8. Starting from the naturally occurring lasso peptide microcin J25, the team grafted the RGDL epitope and iteratively optimized via epitope scanning, structure-guided modeling, and directed evolution of loop, ring, and tail residues. Combining ring substitutions, A3R/T, with I16Q and additional loop/ring edits yielded lassotides with low-nanomolar to sub-nanomolar potency against both integrins, for example, lassotide analogs 12–18 afforded IC<sub>50</sub> values of ~0.7–3 nM. Multi-D NMR confirmed how the scaffolds rigidly presents RGDL in the loop. Computational models predicted that modified ring residues could contribute ancillary β-subunit contacts and allowed further refinement of the binding geometry.</p>
<p>Translational optimization focused on half-life extension without sacrificing potency. Site-specific installation of a PEG2–p-iodophenylbutyrate albumin binder at K20 or K3 produced conjugates such as lassotide 19 that retained dual-integrin potency and sharpened selectivity across the RGD family. Lassotide 19 inhibited αvβ6/αvβ8 at single-digit nanomolar IC50 while maintaining &gt;150-fold selectivity over other RGD integrins, including minimal activity on αIIbβ3. Functional assays mirrored this profile. In MLEC luciferase readouts, 19 blocked αvβ6/8-mediated TGF-β activation to levels comparable with small-molecule standards.</p>
<p>Manufacturability, a historical obstacle for lasso peptides, was overcome through host engineering, pathway optimization, and cyclase redesign. For example, when using the engineered cyclase McjC K252A/K388A, titers climbed from tens of mg/L in flasks to multi-gram per liter yields in fed-batch fermentation. Lassotide 10 reached ~5.65 g/L in 5-L reactors with uniform performance across tanks, enabling &gt;80 g isolation from 20 L broth. This represents the highest reported lasso yield to date and removes a central development bottleneck.</p>
<p>Drug-like PK tracked directly with albumin binding. Compared with the short-lived parent 11 with mouse t½ ~0.6 h, lassotide 19 achieved ~9-fold longer half-life in mice, t½ ~5.5 h, and 8.5 h in rats, with &gt;25-fold AUC gains and &gt;99% plasma protein binding. Double acylation, 24, extended mouse t½ to ~20 h, demonstrating tunable exposure. Tissue distribution placed high concentrations in ovary, mammary, lung, and kidney—sites relevant to αvβ6/8-positive tumors—while sparing platelet targets. Safety screens across 47 liability assays were clean to ~40–45 μM, and both plasma and hepatocyte stability were favorable.</p>
<p>Efficacy emerged where predicted. In the anti-PD-1–resistant EMT6 TNBC model, anti-PD-1 alone or with the short-lived parent 11 had minimal effect, but 19 + anti-PD-1 halted tumor growth and induced multiple regressions, with clear dose-response and durable immunity upon rechallenge. In the ID8 ovarian cancer model, the same combination yielded regression in 5/7 tumors, 2 complete responses, and significant survival benefit that persisted post-treatment—consistent with relief of stromal TGF-β suppression. Across integrin profiling, conjugates preserved the desired narrow spectrum: potent αvβ6/8 inhibition with minimal off-target activity.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that lasso peptides can be precisely engineered, manufactured at scale, and tuned for clinically relevant PK while maintaining exceptional dual selectivity for αvβ6/8. Conceptually, the work highlights 1| the loop-ring orthogonality of the lasso scaffold as a modular handle for separating binding from PK chemistry, 2| selective αvβ6/8 blockade as a tumor-focused alternative to systemic TGF-β inhibition, and 3| the readiness of this modality for translational exploration. The advance is clear: lasso peptides are no longer exotic curiosities but practical immuno-oncology therapeutics, with a direct path to resensitizing checkpoint inhibitor-refractory tumors. Moreover, this work provides a blueprint for further advances using this untapped modality in oncology and beyond.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/burk_et_al_jacs_sep_2025.jpg,,"Overcoming Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Resistance with Potent, Selective Dual αvβ6/8 Inhibitors Based on Engineered Lasso Peptides","Anna Lechner, Peter A.

In these disorders, the native tetrameric structure of TTR becomes destabilized...","<p>The misfolding and aggregation of transthyretin, TTR, a serum protein responsible for transporting thyroxine and retinol binding protein, underlies a class of amyloid diseases that include TTR cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy. In these disorders, the native tetrameric structure of TTR becomes destabilized, dissociating into monomeric intermediates that misfold and self-assemble into soluble oligomers before progressing to insoluble amyloid aggregates. Deposits of these aggregates in the heart and nervous system lead to debilitating, often fatal outcomes. Wild-type TTR amyloidosis alone affects nearly one quarter of individuals over the age of 80, underscoring the urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Current treatment with tafamidis, the first FDA-approved small-molecule stabilizer, works by binding to the central tetramer cavity to prevent dissociation. While effective in slowing disease progression when administered early, tafamidis is less effective in patients with advanced amyloidosis, where irreversible organ damage has already occurred. Moreover, tafamidis does not inhibit seeded aggregation, a process by which pre-existing fibrils act as templates for further amyloid growth. To address these limitations, researchers have developed short peptide inhibitors that mimic the solvent-exposed F and H β-strands of monomeric TTR. These peptides can cap aggregation-prone intermediates, yet until now, their precise effects on the individual kinetic steps of TTR aggregation remained unknown.</p>
<p>In a study published in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em>, researchers from the Peter E. Wright group at Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX, employed real-time <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectroscopy in combination with kinetic modeling to dissect how peptide inhibitors modulate the multi-step aggregation pathway of TTR. Their results provide direct mechanistic evidence that inhibitors such as TabF<sub>2</sub>, TabH<sub>2</sub>, and the concatenated construct ffTAD<sub>1</sub> bind selectively to misfolded monomers, destabilized tetramers, and soluble oligomers at acidic pH. Importantly, these inhibitors do not interact with properly folded tetramers or monomers under neutral conditions, nor do they bind amorphous aggregates formed <em>in vitro</em>. Instead, they preferentially stabilize aggregation-prone intermediates, lowering the rates of tetramer dissociation and forward aggregation while reshaping the free-energy landscape of the pathway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, under conditions that favor the accumulation of soluble oligomers, acidic pH and reduced temperature, the peptide inhibitors also engage these oligomeric species. This observation suggests that the oligomers share structural features with patient-derived amyloid fibrils, reinforcing the therapeutic relevance of these peptide designs. By contrast, the inability of the inhibitors to bind amorphous aggregates formed <em>in vitro</em> highlights important conformational differences between laboratory-generated and <em>in vivo</em> fibrils.</p>
<p>Together, these findings reveal how peptide inhibitors act at the earliest stages of aggregation, providing a quantitative, step-resolved model for how they slow or halt amyloid formation. The work clarifies why these inhibitors display potent sub-stoichiometric activity: because the vulnerable intermediates are present only in low abundance, even small amounts of peptide are sufficient to exert significant inhibitory effects.</p>
<p>Beyond its relevance to TTR amyloidosis, the study establishes a powerful experimental and computational platform for probing aggregation kinetics in detail. By combining <sup>19</sup>F-NMR with kinetic modeling, the approach is readily extendable to other amyloidogenic proteins—including α-synuclein, β-amyloid, and huntingtin—where similar multi-step pathways drive pathological aggregation. In doing so, it opens the door to more precise, mechanism-based design of peptide and small-molecule inhibitors targeting early misfolded states.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wright_et_al_jbc_sep_2025.jpg,,Mechanism of Inhibition of Acid-Mediated Transthyretin Aggregation by Designed Peptides,"Xun Sun, Rose Pedretti, H.

While earlier models invoked lactyl-CoA–dependent transfer or non-enzymatic reactions via lactoylglutathione, the enzymatic basis of Kla remained uncertain. Building on evidence that class I histone deacetylases, HDACs 1–3, catalyze β-hydroxybutyrylation, a study published in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> by researchers in the Burslem and Goldberg Labs at the University of Pennsylvania and University of California, San Francisco, respectively, shows that the same enzymes also directly catalyze lysine lactylation.</p>
<p>Using recombinant proteins, reconstitution assays, and LC–MS/MS, the authors confirmed that HDACs 1, 2, and 3 catalyze Kla on multiple histone lysines, with activity blocked by the pan-HDAC inhibitor <em>trichostatin A</em>. Kinetic analysis revealed parameters, kcat ≈ 0.82 min<sup>-1</sup>, Km ≈ 49 μM, consistent with physiological lactate concentrations, supporting a model in which HDACs use ambient lactate directly, independent of lactyl-CoA. Dialysis experiments confirmed reversibility: HDACs add or remove lactate depending on substrate availability.</p>

</div>
<p>Cellular assays reinforced this catalytic role. Genetic depletion of HDAC1–3 in HEK293T cells reduced global Kla, with triple knockdown producing the strongest effect. Pharmacological inhibition decreased Kla without altering intracellular lactate or lactyl-CoA levels, uncoupling Kla from CoA dependence and pointing directly to HDAC activity. In LDHA/B double knockout cells, loss of glycolytic lactate production abolished Kla, but exogenous l-lactate rescued it, highlighting lactate itself as the substrate. In bone marrow–derived macrophages, LPS/IFNγ-induced glycolysis drove Kla accumulation that was blocked by HDAC inhibitors, showing relevance to immune activation. Glucose availability and inhibitors of lactate production, oxamate, dichloroacetate, modulated Kla, underscoring its tight dependence on metabolic flux.</p>
<p>Knockdown of acyltransferases, p300, CBP, HBO1, and lactyl-CoA synthetases, ACSS2, SUCLG2, had little effect on basal Kla, demonstrating that the dominant pathway in proliferating cells is HDAC-mediated.

<p>These findings reposition class I HDACs as bifunctional acylation enzymes capable of both erasing and depositing short-chain acyl marks, expanding their role beyond canonical deacetylation.

Conventional strategies, stochastic coupling...","<p>For two decades, immunoconjugates have been a mainstay of targeted oncology, from antibody–drug conjugates to radioimmunotherapy probes. The clinical challenge has never been the underlying concept, but rather the chemistry of conjugation. Conventional strategies, stochastic coupling to lysines or other surface residues, are simple and inexpensive but yield heterogeneous mixtures with variable degrees of labeling. This molecular diversity can compromise pharmacokinetics, antigen recognition, and imaging contrast, limiting the translational potential of otherwise powerful agents. As a result, the field has been steadily shifting toward site-specific modification, leveraging unnatural amino acids, chemoenzymatic ligations, or disulfide reduction. Each approach improves homogeneity but introduces new barriers, from cost and complexity to instability of linkages. The need for a fast, robust, and translatable chemical method has been acute.</p>
<p>In a communication published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, researchers in the Zeglis Lab at Hunter College, introduce the AJICAP reagent, a 17-amino acid cyclic peptide that binds to a protein A recognition motif in the Fc domain of IgG1–4 antibodies and directs modification to the heavy-chain lysine K248. Once bound, its thiophenyl ester reacts with the proximal amine, and subsequent hydroxylamine treatment liberates the peptide scaffold to yield a pair of free thiols. This traceless maneuver produces a heavy-chain–specific, sulfhydryl-bearing intermediate ready for thiol-reactive cargo. In prior work, AJICAP enabled antibody–drug conjugates of trastuzumab and rituximab with controlled degree-of-labeling and excellent stability. Here, the platform is extended to the synthesis of radioimmunoconjugates by attaching a bifunctional chelator—CHX-A″-DTPA equipped with a phenyloxadiazolyl methyl sulfone, PODS, group, followed by coordination of therapeutic lutetium-177. The model antibody, 5B1, targets the carbohydrate antigen CA19-9, widely expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, offering a clinically relevant testbed.</p>
<p>The synthetic sequence proved straightforward. AJICAP treatment of 5B1, hydroxylamine cleavage, and conjugation to PODS-DTPA yielded DTPA-<sup>PODS</sup>AJICAP-5B1 in ~65% yield with a degree-of-labeling of 1.8 &plusmn; 0.1. For comparison, two controls were prepared: a disulfide-reduced site-selective conjugate, DTPA-PODS-5B1, and a conventional stochastic lysine conjugate, DTPA-5B1. All three were labeled with [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu<sup>3+</sup> to high yield and radiochemical purity, and all exhibited excellent serum stability over five days. Immunoreactivity toward CA19-9 was retained, with blockable antigen binding and fractions exceeding 0.75. Importantly, autoradiography confirmed heavy-chain localization of the AJICAP modification, consistent with K248 targeting, while the other two approaches produced a broader but still predominantly heavy-chain distribution.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em>, each of the three radioimmunoconjugates displayed strong tumor tropism in BxPC3 pancreatic xenografts, with high and sustained uptake. At 144 h, tumoral accumulation reached 52.0 &plusmn; 24.5 %ID/g for the AJICAP construct, compared with 42.9 &plusmn; 13.7 %ID/g for the disulfide variant and 18.8 ± 5.0 %ID/g for the stochastic analogue. Tumor-to-blood ratios were broadly similar across constructs, but tumor-to-bone ratios were highest for the AJICAP probe. Statistically significant differences emerged mainly in comparisons to the stochastic conjugate, underscoring that even traditional methods can perform well when paired with a robust antibody scaffold such as 5B1. The authors note that the advantages of AJICAP may be more dramatic with less stable immunoglobulins, a hypothesis now under active exploration.</p>
<p>The implications are notable. AJICAP offers a purely chemical, enzyme-free, one-pot/two-step strategy for site-specific conjugation, compatible with native antibodies and modular across payloads. Unlike maleimide–thiol linkages, it avoids instability; unlike enzymatic ligations, it is rapid and low-cost. The product is homogeneous, stable, and in this case, clinically competitive. The authors foresee adaptations toward a single-step AJICAP reagent that directly installs a chelator or drug, further simplifying production and automation.</p>
<p>This work establishes AJICAP as a practical platform for the generation of homogeneous radioimmunoconjugates. While its superiority <em>in vivo</em> may be muted in the context of a highly optimized antibody, the chemistry’s reproducibility, modularity, and scalability mark it as a powerful addition to the toolkit for next-generation radiopharmaceuticals and antibody-based therapeutics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/zeglis_bioconj_chem_aug_2025.jpg,,Harnessing Fc-Directed Bioconjugation for the Synthesis of Site-Specifically Modified Radioimmunoconjugates,"Camilla Grimaldi, Joni Sebastiano, Wei-Siang Mark Kao, Emilia Strugala, Shane A.

20208,Ultrafast Peptide Cyclization,9/21/25 15:15,Hao,Sun,Professor,Nanjing Agricultural University,,Ultrafast Peptide Cyclization,"Cyclic peptides occupy a privileged niche in chemical biology. Their constrained conformations reduce entropic penalties upon binding, impart proteolytic stability, and frequently enable access to protein–protein interaction surfaces that are inaccessible to small molecules...","<p>Cyclic peptides occupy a privileged niche in chemical biology. Their constrained conformations reduce entropic penalties upon binding, impart proteolytic stability, and frequently enable access to protein–protein interaction surfaces that are inaccessible to small molecules. These attributes have made cyclic scaffolds attractive starting points for therapeutics with antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Yet the practical chemistry of building them has often lagged behind the imagination of their applications. Cyclization is entropically costly, and many strategies demand protecting-group gymnastics or carefully engineered monomers to avoid side reactions. The result is a field rich in approaches—disulfides, lactams, triazoles, thioethers, hydrogen-bond surrogates—but still hungry for a method that is broadly selective, gentle, and operationally simple.</p>

<p>In a study published in <em>Organic Letters</em>, researchers from the Xue and Sun Groups, at China Pharmaceutical University and Nanjing Agricultural University, respectively, address precisely that gap by exploiting a subtle property of cysteine thiols: their nucleophilicity and low natural abundance. Cysteine has long been favored for selective conjugation, but most Cys-based cyclizations proceed under basic conditions, where competing nucleophiles—particularly amines—can intrude. Acidic conditions would be cleaner, yet few such methods exist. The authors introduce a solution: dimethylolurea, DMU, a commercially available, water-soluble reagent with two hydroxyamidomethyl groups. In the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, TFA—already ubiquitous in peptide chemistry—they show that DMU rapidly and selectively couples a pair of cysteine residues, forging a covalent bridge under conditions that are both peptide-compatible and operationally convenient.</p>

<p>Optimization experiments reveal the power of this approach. A model peptide cyclized with DMU in a mixed TFA/MeCN/H<sub>2</sub>O solvent undergoes &gt;40% conversion in less than 10 seconds, and modest adjustments in solvent ratios push the yield above 70%. The reaction is insensitive to temperature, highly reproducible, and—most importantly—chemoselective: replacing the cysteines with lysines abolishes cyclization, confirming that thiols are the privileged nucleophiles. Bulky neighboring residues impose only minor penalties, underscoring the compatibility of the method with diverse sequence contexts. Even more intriguingly, the DMU-linked ring can be reopened with PdCl<sub>2</sub>, regenerating the linear precursor, providing a reversible toggle between linear and cyclic states.</p>

<p>The scope extends well beyond model systems. By varying the spacing between terminal cysteines, the authors prepare macrocycles of different ring sizes and observe the expected decline in efficiency with longer loops, but still detect productive cyclization even in peptides approaching thirty residues. Internal cysteine pairs also participate, yielding internally bridged macrocycles with respectable conversions. These findings suggest the method can be adapted to diverse peptide architectures, not merely terminally bracketed motifs.</p>

<p>Biological relevance is highlighted through two case studies. The first involves P18, an 18-mer derived from the tumor-associated protein azurin that binds p53 and prevents its ubiquitination. Cyclization of P18 via DMU preserves its α-helical structure, confirmed by circular dichroism, but dramatically enhances its affinity for p53, lowering the dissociation constant from 7.1 μM to 0.14 μM—a 50-fold improvement. The second example applies the method to pHCT74, a peptide ligand of ENO1 expressed on prostate tumor cells. Here again, cyclization improves binding, reducing the dissociation constant from 55 μM to 1.3 μM. In both cases, cyclization does not compromise folding but instead sharpens molecular recognition.</p>

<p>Beyond affinity, the study probes cell permeability. Fluorescein-labeled P18 derivatives demonstrate stark differences: the linear version barely enters MCF-7 cells, while the DMU-cyclized variant penetrates readily, diffusing throughout the cytosol. This underscores a broader point: cyclization not only strengthens binding but also confers the pharmacokinetic attributes necessary for intracellular targets.</p>

<p>Taken together, these results position DMU-mediated cysteine cyclization as an elegant addition to the peptide chemist’s toolkit. It is fast, selective, acid-tolerant, and operationally simple, leveraging reagents and conditions already familiar in peptide synthesis laboratories. The method works across ring sizes and sequence contexts, improves binding affinity in functional peptides, and enhances cell penetration—all without disturbing secondary structure. The reversibility of the linkage adds a further dimension, opening possibilities for switchable or conditionally activated peptides.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the chemistry suggests fertile directions. Asymmetric DMU derivatives could install heterobifunctional crosslinks for dual functionalization. Integration into solid-phase workflows could allow “one-pot” deprotection, cleavage, and cyclization. Most importantly, the method lowers the practical barrier to exploring cyclic peptide chemical space, encouraging broader discovery of peptide modulators for targets once thought undruggable.</p>

<p>In short, this work reframes an old challenge with a simple insight: by moving cyclization into the acidic, TFA-dominated environment that peptides already inhabit, and by using a readily available crosslinker, one can turn cysteine’s thiol into a precise handle for macrocyclization. The result is a strategy that is as chemically neat as it is biologically consequential, offering a direct path toward peptide therapeutics with improved stability, binding, and cell access.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sun_xue_org_lett_aug_2025.jpg,,Trifluoroacetic Acid Promotes Ultrafast Peptide Cyclization Mediated with Dimethylolurea,"Shi Wang, Huanhuan Yang, Jinglin Song, Yang Zhao, Cong Liu, Jiaqi Shao, Siqi Zhou, Ganga B.

Because TF is sequestered...","<p>Hemostasis begins with a handshake. When vascular damage exposes tissue factor, TF, to the bloodstream, factor VII, FVII, latches on, instantly engaging the extrinsic pathway and accelerating thrombin generation. Because TF is sequestered outside intact vessels, the TF:FVIIa complex behaves like a conditional switch: silent in health, fast and local in injury. That logic makes the interface a compelling drug target—intercept the switch and you can temper coagulation before the system amplifies itself, potentially with less bleeding risk than blocking catalytic sites downstream.</p>

<p>In work published in the <em>European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry</em>, researchers from the Institute of Biostructure and Bioimaging, Naples, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, University Federico II, Naples, and BIOVIIIx, Naples, Italy, pursue an elegant minimalism: distill a sliver of TF’s β-sheet surface that grips FVIIa, and present it back to the protease as a compact β-hairpin. The structural template comes from the crystal complex, for example, PDB 1DAN/2A2Q, where two TF strands—106–110, RVFSY, and 123–128, EPLYEN, abut a narrow hot spot on FVIIa centered on Met366 within the LMTQD, 365–369 segment. To translate that interface into a peptide, they tether the two TF strands with a di-proline turn and staple the termini with a disulfide, yielding a monocyclic scaffold with the general architecture Cys–EPLYEN–Pro–Pro–RVFSY–Cys. Crucially, the chirality of each proline is a design dial. By permuting L/D configurations—PP, Pp, pP, pp—they can bias the turn geometry and, with luck, recreate the strand alignment TF uses in the native complex.</p>

<p>The chemistry performs cleanly. Linear precursors cyclize in ~16 h to &gt;95% purity with masses matching theory; yields settle around 20–29%. Recombinant human FVII, HEK293 expression, behaves as expected by SDS–PAGE, CD, and a chromogenic activity assay, providing a reliable binding and function partner.</p>

<p>Conformation proves to be destiny. CD spectroscopy at neutral pH draws a line between candidates: pP-TF, D-Pro–L-Pro, shows a strong β-sheet signature, minimum ~215 nm, pp-TF, D–D, shows a weaker but present sheet signal, while PP-TF, L–L, and Pp-TF, L–D, look random. NMR sharpens the picture. All four peptides display <em>cis</em>/<em>trans</em> behavior at the central proline–proline bond, but the populations differ: pP-TF is ~70% trans and adopts a canonical β-hairpin in the majority of structures; pp-TF achieves a β-hairpin only in its ~25–30% <em>cis</em> subpopulation; PP-TF and Pp-TF distribute among multiple isomers with no stable hairpin. The spectroscopic hierarchy foreshadows biology.</p>

<p>When binding is quantified by microscale thermophoresis, only the hairpin-competent peptides engage FVII: pP-TF and pp-TF bind in the low-to-mid micromolar range, K_D ≈ 70 ± 25 μM and 67 ± 20 μM, respectively. The random-coil variants do not register measurable affinity. Function tracks structure as well. In a TF-dependent chromogenic assay, pP-TF suppresses FVII activity by &gt;40% at 50–100 μM; pp-TF achieves ~11% and ~27% inhibition at the same doses; Pp-TF barely moves the needle, ~13% at 100 μM. For short, rigid scaffolds hand-picked from an extended protein interface, those are meaningful effects at an exceptionally upstream checkpoint in the cascade.</p>

<p>Computation fills in the contact physics. All-atom MD of each cyclopeptide docked onto FVIIa begins from the TF-derived pose and watches what holds. pP-TF stays where it should: its RMSD centers around ~2.2 Å, it preserves salt bridges between Glu2 and Arg364/Arg439 and between Arg10 and Asp369, and it intermittently forms π–π contacts between Phe12/Tyr14 and Phe335 on FVIIa. Contact maps echo the experimental design: pP-TF most faithfully recapitulates the TF segments’ interactions with the FVIIa 365–369 hotspot and neighboring R331/F335/M336–D339/R439 region. pp-TF, less pre-organized, samples multiple surface patches and often migrates toward a flexible loop, 189–210. PP-TF and Pp-TF disperse further, with contacts transient and poorly aligned to the native TF footprint. A residue-level RMSF analysis mirrors those trends: pP-TF is the least mobile overall, while Tyr5, Arg10, Phe12 are universally the liveliest side chains, consistent with their roles at the binding interface.</p>

<p>Two design choices deserve special credit. First, stereochemical tuning at the turn: flipping one proline to D enforces the geometry needed for the strands to face each other and register hydrogen bonds—hence the leap in β-hairpin population, and activity, for pP-TF versus PP-TF. Second, placing the rigid element, the Pro–Pro linkage, at the closer ends of the native strands, N128&harr;R106, and the more flexible disulfide across the farther ends, E123&harr;Y110, reproduces the spatial constraints seen in TF, rather than fighting them. Together those moves convert a broad, multi-contact protein surface into a 13–14 residue loop that actually behaves like the parent interface.</p>

<p>How do these hairpin mimics stack up pharmacologically? They will not out-compete active-site protease inhibitors in potency. But potency is not the point. These synthetic, conformationally defined cyclopeptides strike at the TF:FVIIa handshake itself, a regulatory move that preserves downstream protease function elsewhere and may therefore lower bleeding liability relative to catalytic blockade. Compared with antibodies or recombinant inhibitors, for example, TFPI, active-site inhibited FVIIa, they are smaller, cheaper to make, and structurally modular. Compared with earlier loop-derived peptides from TF or FVII, often millimolar binders, they are both tighter and better organized. And because their activity correlates tightly with β-hairpin content, the path to optimization is clear: stabilize the hairpin, strengthen the hot-spot contacts, and maintain the disulfide- and turn-encoded rigidity that underwrites enzymatic stability.</p>

<p>That roadmap is already sketched. Turn surrogates could replace the di-Pro to fix the geometry and resist isomerization. Targeted side-chain edits on the RVFSY/EPLYEN faces, for example, electrostatic reinforcement of the Glu2&harr;Arg364/Arg439 and Arg10&harr;Asp369 axes or aromatic tuning around Phe335, should boost on-target residence. Depeptidizing the flanks while retaining the disulfide and hairpin hydrogen-bonding could improve exposure without sacrificing fold. And the design space is not limited to FVIIa: hairpin grafts can be transplanted onto heterogeneous scaffolds to tune PK while preserving the interaction grammar learned here.</p>

<p>The biological logic remains compelling. Because TF lives outside intact vessels, interfering with the TF:FVIIa interface promises context-dependent anticoagulation—quieter in health, more active where TF is pathologically exposed, for example, DIC, sepsis, cancer-associated coagulopathy. In that sense these β-hairpin mimics are not merely binders; they are structurally informed levers at the top of the coagulation cascade. With the pP-TF scaffold as a starting point—conformationally compact, β-hairpin-rich, and already functional—the next generation of TF-interface inhibitors looks less like a moonshot and more like a matter of precision stereochemistry and contact engineering.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ruvo_et_al_eur_med_chem_aug_25.jpg,,Tissue Factor Derived β-Hairpin Peptides that Bind and Inhibit FVII Activity,"Angela Oliver, Emanuela Iaccarino, Arianna Migliorini, Samuele Di Cristofano, Lucia Falcigno, Gabriella D'Auria, Maria Cantile, Raffaele Ronca, Riccardo Sanna, Domenico Raimondo, Annamaria Sandomenico, Menotti Ruvo","<em>Eur.

Nature’s favorites at Xaa and Yaa—proline, Pro, and 4-hydroxyproline, Hyp, earn their place by pre-organizing ϕ/ψ around PPII yet pay a price: tertiary amides with a nontrivial <em>cis</em> population that the collagen fold must continually fight back to <em>trans</em>. That tension has inspired a generation of chemists to probe how far the code can be bent—swapping in peptoids, N-alkylglycines, fluorinated prolines, azaprolines—without unthreading the helix.</p>

<p>In a study published in <em>Peptide Science</em>, Wright, Rathman, and Del Valle from the University of Notre Dame, push that exploration into azapeptoids, replacing the peptoid backbone methylene, CH<sub>2</sub>R, with NHR to give N-aminoglycine, aGly, and its N'-alkylated congeners. Conceptually, azapeptoids are a clean thought experiment: they preserve the tertiary amide character that often correlates with collagen stability in peptoids, but they introduce a hydrazide N–H capable of hydrogen bonding and subtly different rotational energetics. The authors ask a pointed question: when such residues are placed at the central Xaa, position 11, of a standard (Gly-Pro-Hyp)<sub>7</sub> collagen mimetic peptide, CMP, do they stabilize, destabilize, or simply get out of the way?</p>

<p>The answer is nuanced and mechanistically revealing. By circular dichroism, CD, at pH 7.4, all variants—Pro11 as the parent, aGly11, aAla11, and the canonical Gly11/Ala11 controls—display native PPII/triple-helical signatures, max ≈ 225 nm, min ≈ 204 nm. In other words, the fold tolerates the substitution. Thermodynamics is where the differences emerge. The parent Pro11-CMP melts at 53.2 °C. Swapping Pro for Gly or Ala lowers stability as expected, 36.9 °C and 46.6 °C, respectively, recapitulating the classic PPII propensities. Introducing an azapeptoid at Xaa yields split behavior: aGly11-CMP sits at 44.7 °C, a clear gain over Gly11 but still below Pro11, while aAla11-CMP drops further to 39.7 °C. That divergence echoes prior single-strand work from the same group: N-amination of Gly promotes PPII, whereas N-amination of a Cα-substituted residue tends to bias β-strand-like conformations.</p>

<p>To test whether hydrophobic “peptoid logic” carries over to azapeptoids, the team executes a neat late-stage N′-alkylation on aGly11-CMP, reductively appending eight different groups, isopropyl, butyl, benzyl, cyclohexyl, et cetera, directly onto the hydrazide. The CD fingerprints remain triple-helical, but the thermal map is not a simple replay of peptoid behavior. Most N'-alkylations do not raise T<sub>m</sub>; some even depress it, for example, n-pentyl to 38.8 °C, benzyl to 40.9 °C. Two standouts, however—(iPr)aGly11-CMP and (Bu)aGly11-CMP—deliver modest, reproducible gains, ≈ +1.4–1.6 °C, to 46.3 °C and 46.1 °C, respectively, relative to aGly11. The take-home is that hydrophobic bulk alone—so successful in many peptoid CMPs—does not guarantee stabilization in the azapeptoid context; local H-bonding and subtle electronic effects of the hydrazide N–H likely reshape the balance between PPII pre-organization and unwanted <em>cis</em> bias.</p>

<p>Kinetics provide a second line of insight. The rate-determining step in collagen refolding is <em>cis</em>/<em>trans</em> isomerization of the tertiary amide. The authors previously accelerated refolding with a δ-oxaproline that lowers the isomerization barrier. By contrast, hysteresis CD here shows that neither aGly11 nor (iPr)aGly11 significantly changes the refolding rate relative to Pro11. Thus, the hydrazide subtly perturbs thermodynamics without offering a kinetic shortcut; the triple helix still pays the same isomerization toll during assembly.</p>

<p>Methodologically, the work is tight and modular. Standard Fmoc SPPS builds the CMPs, while submonomer tactics and on-resin activations install aGly/aAla cleanly. The N'-alkylation is executed after cleavage—an attractive late-stage handle for tuning physicochemical properties without re-synthesis. Throughout, analytical rigor, RP-HPLC, HRMS, quantitative CD melts, two-state fits, keeps the comparisons on firm ground.</p>

<p>What does this teach us about the collagen code? First, azapeptoids are welcome—but not neutral—guests at Xaa. The aGly backbone is thermodynamically kinder to PPII than Gly, which is encouraging for designing CMPs that need functionality at the backbone nitrogen without sacrificing the fold. Second, select N'-alkyl groups can claw back part of the stability lost relative to Pro, but the hydrazide’s H-bond donor appears to compete with the pre-organization benefits that make peptoids successful. This leads to a crisp hypothesis, and the authors’ forward look: dialkylated azapeptoids that remove the N–H should disentangle those effects—retaining favorable tertiary-amide character and hydrophobic tuning while eliminating the destabilizing H-bond.</p>

<p>In sum, azapeptoid residues give collagen chemists a new backbone dial: a way to functionalize the amide nitrogen, tune stability in both directions, and decouple thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to folding. The numbers matter—Pro11 53.2 °C; aGly11 44.7 °C; (iPr)aGly11 and (Bu)aGly11 ≈ 46 °C; Gly11 36.9 °C; Ala11 46.6 °C—but the concept matters more: backbone N-substitution is not merely tolerated by the triple helix; it is designable. With dialkylated variants on deck, this chemistry is poised to clarify how tertiary-amide electronics, local H-bonding, and hydrophobicity choreograph PPII pre-organization—and to expand the palette for CMP engineering in materials and medicine.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/del_valle_peptide_science_aug_25.jpg,,Incorporation of Azapeptoid Residues Into Collagen,"Madison M.

<p>The concept rests on a simple but daring hypothesis: that alkyl iodides, long recognized as versatile synthetic handles in small-molecule chemistry, might persist within the dense, reactive environment of peptides. Achieving this required designing a robust “one-pot” desulfoiodination strategy, wherein cysteine residues undergo a disulfide exchange, then react with electron-deficient phosphines to generate phosphonium sulfides capable of clean iodination. After careful screening, the team identified tri(3-methylthiophen-2-yl)phosphine as a key reagent, enabling nearly quantitative conversion of cysteine to 3-iodoalanine under mild, aqueous conditions.</p>

<p>This electrophilic editing method proved broadly applicable. Complex peptides bearing lysine, arginine, tyrosine, or aspartic acid—all potentially competing nucleophiles—were efficiently iodinated, and the resulting products showed no evidence of racemization, a persistent drawback in other cysteine-to-dehydroalanine methods. The new chemistry also tolerated proximity effects, with successful modification even when multiple reactive side chains were clustered near the cysteine target site. Stability assays revealed that the newly installed C–I bonds persisted for many hours under physiological buffer conditions, sufficient to enable downstream transformations.</p> 

<p>Critically, the iodinated peptides could undergo a wide array of subsequent modifications. Direct thiolation converted them into lanthipeptide-like structures; selective acylation generated site-specific Nε-acetyllysine residues adjacent to cysteine; and even demanding cross-coupling reactions such as nickel-mediated Negishi arylations succeeded in the context of unprotected peptides. Together, these results show that iodinated residues function as orthogonal handles, opening a chemical toolbox typically reserved for small organic molecules but now applicable to biomacromolecules.</p> 

<p>The implications are wide-reaching. By reengineering cysteine from a nucleophile into an electrophile, the authors demonstrate an “umpolung” strategy that bypasses the constraints of canonical amino acid chemistry. This innovation offers a new platform for late-stage peptide diversification, with potential in probing protein function, engineering biomaterials, and designing therapeutics. Beyond cysteine itself, the work suggests a broader design principle: rethinking side-chain reactivity as something to be <em>converted</em> rather than merely conjugated. In doing so, peptide science takes a significant step toward the vast and largely untapped chemical space of electrophilic biomolecules.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wang_goldberg.jpg,,Direct Editing of Cysteine to Electrophilic Alkyl Halides in Peptides,"Daniel S.

20176,Rewiring the Protein Backbone,9/8/25 16:53,Alanna,Schepartz,Distinguished Professor,University of California at Berkeley,,Rewiring the Protein Backbone,"Backbone editing offers a powerful way to expand protein function: by introducing β, γ, or δ linkages, researchers can strengthen folds against proteolysis, reshape ligand dynamics, and unlock new routes to modulate protein–protein interactions…","<p>The promise of proteins whose backbones deviate from the canonical α-architecture has been clear for decades: a few strategically placed methylene units can toughen a chain against proteolysis, reshape cell permeability, retune major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation, or reorganize a binding surface to modulate protein–protein interactions. Yet despite that promise, reliably installing extended-backbone linkages—β, γ, or δ—<em>in cells</em> has remained frustratingly rare. The obstacles are familiar—engineered monomers strain EF-Tu delivery, challenge the ribosome’s peptidyl-transferase chemistry, and often depend on stoichiometric tRNA acylation tactics that do not port readily to living systems. In a study published in <em>Nature Chemical Biology</em> by researchers in the Alanna Schepartz and Matthew B. Francis groups at the University of California, Berkeley, in collaboration with colleagues from the Scott J. Miller group at Yale, the authors sidestep those constraints by reframing backbone engineering as a post-translational problem. Rather than forcing the ribosome to stitch in a β/γ/δ unit, they embed a latent rearrangement into a ribosomal product and let the protein edit itself. Their work was accompanied by a <em>Nature Chemical Biology</em> <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-025-02000-4"">Research Briefing</a> that highlights the broader significance of this strategy.</p>
<p>The centerpiece is the Backbone Extension Acyl Rearrangement, BEAR, an intramolecular acyl shift analogous to the second step of native chemical ligation. During translation in <em>E. coli</em>, an orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA pair installs α-hydroxy-acid analogs whose side chains carry masked nucleophiles. After expression, the mask is removed—photochemically or chemically—to reveal a tethered amine that is preorganized to attack the neighboring O-acyl linkage. The result is a spontaneous O&rarr;N acyl transfer that both forges an amide and adds methylene unit(s) to the main chain, yielding a site-specific β<sub>2</sub>, γ, or δ backbone within a full-length, genetically encoded protein.</p> 
<p>Density functional theory provides the first indication that such edits should work. Across model systems corresponding to the β, γ, and δ cases, BEAR rearrangements are thermodynamically favored relative to canonical cysteine/serine NCL analogs by roughly 2–3&nbsp;kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>, an advantage traced to stabilizing hydrogen bonds in the products and relief of steric congestion. The intermediates pay a higher entropic price—especially for the seven-membered ring en route to a δ linkage—foreshadowing slower kinetics for δ relative to β or γ. Those expectations map cleanly onto the experimental data.</p> 
<p>To test feasibility in a protein context, the team first targets a single site in NanoLuc with a photomasked α-hydroxy isoserine (pm-isoS) that can unveil a β-amine upon irradiation and thereby trigger a β<sub>2</sub>-forming O&rarr;N shift. Installation via a PylRS variant proceeds in cells; controlled photolysis then drives the rearrangement. Intact-protein LC–MS confirms correct mass, but the decisive evidence comes from peptide-level co-elution with a synthetic standard containing the anticipated β<sub>2</sub> linkage and indistinguishable MS/MS fragmentation—a rigorous fingerprint that the backbone truly has been extended at the programmed site. A practical note emerges here: executing the unmasking after purification improves conversion and reduces hydrolysis and background, yielding cleaner maps than in-cell light exposure.</p> 
<p>Having established the principle, the authors pivot to a γ-extension, using γ-N<sub>3</sub>-OH, an azide-bearing α-hydroxy acid that can be reduced to a γ-amine and then allowed to rearrange. Expression in SUMO–GFP is robust, notably in C321.ΔA.exp cells, and the purified protein again matches the expected mass. The reduction chemistry matters: commonplace phosphines such as TCEP or THPP generate significant alcohol side product from azide, diminishing the desired rearrangement. In contrast, 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) cleanly unmasks the amine with minimal diversion, and under mildly basic conditions, pH&nbsp;8.2; 0&nbsp;°C then 42&nbsp;°C, the intramolecular O&rarr;N transfer proceeds to near-quantitative yield with &gt;90% fidelity at the edited position. One mechanistic nuance is instructive: at elevated pH in the absence of a reductant, ester hydrolysis competes, inflating apparent misincorporation in mapping; driving BEAR promptly after unmasking solves that problem by replacing the labile ester with a stable amide.</p> 
<p>The most challenging case is the δ-extension, which must traverse a higher-energy, seven-membered intermediate. Here, the group incorporates δ-N<sub>3</sub>-OH at a defined site in SUMO–GFP, purifies the single-site variant, and explores conditions that favor the rearrangement after azide reduction. As predicted by theory, time and temperature are the levers: extended incubations, PTA, pH&nbsp;8.2, 50&nbsp;°C, 48&nbsp;h, convert the reduced intermediate into the δ-linked product in ~27% yield, with hydrolysis as the principal competitor under the harsher conditions. The outcome is still a landmark: a site-specific δ linkage formed inside a folded, full-length protein expressed in cells, achieved without ribosome or EF-Tu engineering.</p> 
<p>Methodologically, BEAR is notable for what it doesn’t require. There is no need to retool the ribosome’s active site or tune EF-Tu to carry non-standard cargo. The only special machinery is an orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pair capable of accepting α-hydroxy acids that bear maskable nucleophiles. From there, chemistry takes over: unmask the side chain, allow the preorganized intramolecular attack, and capture the extended backbone as a standard amide. The strategy is modular, choice of mask, trigger, and nucleophile, temporal, unmasking can be staged in cells or after purification; photochemistry offers spatial control, and general, the same logic should translate to other nucleophiles and caging groups, broadening the palette beyond the β/γ/δ exemplars.</p> 
<p>The implications for peptide and protein science are immediate. A few judiciously spaced β/γ/δ edits can harden a fold against proteases, reshape dynamics at a ligand interface, or dial in cooperative assembly to yield protein-like materials with enhanced thermal stability. For chemical biology, BEAR offers precision backbone editing for mechanistic probes—altering H-bond geometry, backbone length, or conformational bias at a single site without changing side-chain identity. In translational contexts, one can imagine PPI modulators that exploit γ- or δ-spacing to access otherwise unreachable pharmacophores, or antigens whose MHC presentation is tuned by a backbone extension to rebalance immunogenicity. And because the edits are encoded at the gene level and executed inside cells, scale and evolvability—two chronic weaknesses of purely synthetic routes—come back into play.</p> 
<p>There are, of course, boundaries to push. The δ case underscores that kinetics and local structure matter; sequence context, folding constraints, and microenvironment will influence rearrangement rates and competing hydrolysis. Expanding the aaRS specificity space for alternative masked monomers will widen the design window, even if the ribosome and EF-Tu remain blissfully unmodified. And the most exciting frontier is likely spatiotemporal control in living cells: photomasks and bioorthogonal triggers that confine backbone edits to defined subcellular locales or time windows, turning BEAR into a tool for dynamic proteome engineering.</p> 
<p>In sum, BEAR converts a long-standing encoding challenge into a tractable chemical edit. By programming a post-translational acyl rearrangement into a ribosomally produced chain, the authors show that β<sub>2</sub>, γ, and δ linkages can be installed site-selectively in full-length proteins expressed <em>in vivo</em>, with rigorous peptide-level validation. It is a conceptually clean and practically flexible framework—one that should accelerate the creation and evolution of extended-backbone protein hybrids for basic science, materials design, and next-generation therapeutics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/schepartz_nat_chem_bio_aug_25.jpg,,Site-Selective Protein Editing by Backbone Extension Acyl Rearrangements,"Leah T.

Once thought to be in gradual decline, TB incidence has reversed course, fueled by the rise of multidrug-resistant, MDR, and extensively drug-resistant, XDR, strains. The causative...","<p>Tuberculosis, TB, remains one of the most pressing global health threats, with more than ten million cases reported in 2022. Once thought to be in gradual decline, TB incidence has reversed course, fueled by the rise of multidrug-resistant, MDR, and extensively drug-resistant, XDR, strains. The causative pathogen, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>Mtb</em>, owes much of its persistence to its formidable cell envelope — a multilayered barrier comprising an inner membrane, peptidoglycan, an arabinogalactan layer, and, most critically, an unusually thick, hydrophobic mycomembrane. Rich in mycolic acids and glycolipids, this outer layer forms a permeability barrier that has shaped the chemical space of effective TB drugs. Nearly all frontline antibiotics are small, hydrophobic molecules that can squeeze through this envelope, but decades of overuse have left them vulnerable to resistance. Only two new drugs, bedaquiline and pretomanid, have been introduced in recent years, both still small and hydrophobic.</p>

<p>Yet there are striking exceptions. Rifampicin and streptomycin, for instance, show that larger, more polar molecules — including peptides — can in fact succeed against mycobacteria. The pharmaceutical field more broadly has already embraced peptides, particularly those exceeding Lipinski’s Rule of Five, as promising scaffolds in oncology, metabolic disease, and antibacterial discovery. Macrocyclic peptides such as Zosurabalpin, which targets carbapenem-resistant <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, underscore the potential of these scaffolds in otherwise intractable infections. Natural products like evybactin and cyclomarin A have further fueled optimism, inspiring BacPROTAC-based antimycobacterial strategies.</p>

<p>A key bottleneck in mycobacterial peptide development, however, has been the inability to measure whether candidate molecules truly accumulate past the mycomembrane. Standard LC–MS/MS can quantify whole-cell associations but cannot readily pinpoint subcellular location. To address this, researchers in the Marcos Pires Group at the University of Virgina, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, under first authors Rachita Dash and Zichen Liu, developed PAC-MAN — Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click-Mediated Assessment — a live-cell assay that uses engineered peptidoglycan landmarks, via DBCO modification, and bioorthogonal click chemistry to ""register"" the arrival of azide-tagged molecules at the PG layer. In essence, PAC-MAN reports directly on whether a molecule has traversed the mycomembrane, offering both throughput and precision at the periplasmic scale.</p>

<p>Using <em>Mycobacterium smegmatis</em> as a model system, the researchers optimized PAC-MAN for peptides, establishing dose-dependent accumulation curves that paralleled mammalian penetration assays such as Chloroalkane Penetration Assay, CAPA. They validated the chemical installation of dibenzocyclooctyne, DBCO. in the peptidoglycan, confirmed that fluorophore choice and labeling concentrations did not confound results, and showed that apparent accumulation correlated robustly with exposure time and concentration.</p>

<p>With this foundation, they turned to two structural strategies common in natural products but not empirically tested in mycobacteria: backbone <em>N-</em>alkylation and macrocyclization. Backbone <em>N-</em>methylation of simple model peptides revealed that just one or two methyl groups could sharply enhance accumulation, particularly toward the C-terminal backbone. Higher levels of methylation did not always confer added benefit, and in some cases reduced accumulation, reflecting the nuanced balance between conformational preferences and permeability. Extending this logic, the team built peptoid analogs, which replace backbone amides with <em>N-</em>substituted glycines. These peptoids often accumulated even more effectively than methylated peptides, highlighting the broad potential of backbone alkylation to reduce desolvation penalties and promote passage through the mycomembrane.</p>

<p>Macrocyclization offered complementary insights. Cyclic peptides consistently outperformed their linear analogs, especially at smaller ring sizes where intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces solvent exposure. Lariat-shaped macrocycles showed organism-specific trends, with some scaffolds accumulating better in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> than in <em>M. smegmatis</em>. Cyclization chemistry also mattered: thioether-linked cycles improved accumulation, while disulfide linkages sometimes introduced vulnerabilities to thiol exchange at the envelope. NMR hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiments confirmed that cyclic peptides exhibited greater protection of backbone amide hydrogens, consistent with reduced solvent accessibility. Moreover, cyclic scaffolds proved far more stable in serum than their linear counterparts, underscoring the pharmacological benefits of cyclization.</p>

<p>The team then applied these principles to real antibiotic scaffolds. Tridecaptin A1, traditionally inactive against mycobacteria, was redesigned through <em>N-</em>methylation and macrocyclization. These modifications improved both accumulation and antimicrobial activity, reducing MIC values against <em>M. smegmatis</em> by up to eight-fold. Interestingly, while the parent tridecaptin disrupted the cell envelope nonspecifically, <em>N-</em>methylated analogs avoided this liability while gaining potency. Griselimycin, a natural product already bearing both macrocyclization and <em>N-</em>methylation, provided a complementary test: removing either feature significantly reduced activity, confirming their essential roles in preserving efficacy.</p>

<p>Together, these results provide the first systematic rules for tuning peptide permeability in mycobacteria. <em>N-</em>alkylation and macrocyclization — long recognized in mammalian systems — also enhance peptide accumulation across the mycomembrane, though with important context-dependent subtleties. PAC-MAN enables these relationships to be mapped at scale, establishing empirical guidelines for redesigning natural products and synthetic peptides alike.</p>

<p>This work reframes the conventional belief that mycobacteria are impenetrable to large, hydrophilic molecules. Instead, it demonstrates that rational structural edits can transform poorly permeable peptides into viable antimycobacterial candidates. By aligning natural product-inspired chemistry with empirical accumulation data, Dash and colleagues have laid the groundwork for a new peptide-based antibiotic pipeline against TB and its drug-resistant forms.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dash_acs_chem_biol.jpg,,Systematic Determination of the Impact of Structural Edits on Peptide Accumulation into Mycobacteria,"Rachita Dash, Zichen Liu, Irene Lepori, Mahendra D.

20133,Blocking Metastasis,9/4/25 14:38,Eileen,Kennedy,Professor,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,Blocking Metastasis,"Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, and one driver of this process is the actin cytoskeleton remodeling mediated by WASF3, a protein strongly upregulated in aggressive tumor types...","<p>Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, and one driver of this process is the actin cytoskeleton remodeling mediated by WASF3, a protein strongly upregulated in aggressive tumor types. Despite its centrality in invasion and metastasis, no effective probes have existed to directly disrupt WASF3 activity within its regulatory complex.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, researchers in the Eileen Kennedy Group at the university of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, report in <em>ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters</em> the design of stapled peptide mimics of BRK1, a critical—but understudied—component of the WASF Regulatory Complex. Their approach leverages hydrocarbon-stapled helices to displace BRK1, destabilizing the WRC and downregulating WASF3 activity, thereby inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion.</p>
<p>Using homology modeling of the WASF3–ABI2–BRK1 trimer and <em>in silico</em> alanine scanning, a hotspot within BRK1, residues 19–41, was identified as the interface mediating interaction with ABI2-WASF3. Two stapled peptides, BASH-1 and BASH-2, incorporating hydrocarbon staples at i,i+4 positions and solubilizing modifications, lysine substitutions, PEG3 linker, were synthesized. Circular dichroism confirmed enhanced α-helicity compared to the native sequence, and microscopy/flow cytometry demonstrated cellular uptake in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>Functionally, both BASH peptides reduced cell migration by 45–60% in wound-healing assays, with BASH-2 showing superior potency and clear dose dependence. Invasion assays across a Matrigel barrier confirmed BASH-2 as a robust inhibitor of invasion, achieving &gt;90% reduction at 1 μM, outperforming a previously reported WASF3-derived stapled peptide, WAHMIS-2. Importantly, activity was sequence-specific, as scrambled controls were inactive, and treatment showed no cytotoxicity up to 48 h. Similar results were obtained in prostate cancer PC-3 cells, underscoring generalizability across WASF3-expressing cancers.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, biotinylated pulldown assays revealed BASH-2 interacts directly with ABI2 and WASF3, consistent with displacement of BRK1 and destabilization of the WRC. In contrast, WAHMIS-2 bound only ABI2, and scrambled controls lacked activity. Phalloidin staining demonstrated BASH-2 disrupted lamellipodia-associated actin localization at the leading edge, inducing stress fiber formation indicative of suppressed motility.</p>
<p>Collectively, this study introduces BASH-2 as the first BRK1-mimetic stapled peptide capable of permeating cells, engaging the WASF3 WRC, and potently inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion. These results establish BRK1 as a druggable node within the WRC and validate stapled peptides as effective tools for targeting its helical protein–protein interfaces. The findings highlight potential for synergistic strategies, combining BRK1-derived inhibitors with other WRC-targeting peptides or upstream WASF3 regulators, for example, STAT3, PI3K, ABL inhibitors. By directly impairing metastatic processes, BASH-2 and related molecules may complement standard chemotherapies, reducing tumor burden and addressing the critical unmet need for anti-metastatic agents in aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kennedy_acs_med_chem_august_25.jpg,,Development of an All-Hydrocarbon Stapled Peptide Targeting BRK1 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Matthew K.

While classical proteolysis-targeting chimeras, PROTACs, exploit the ubiquitin–proteasome system to eliminate disease-relevant proteins, peptide-based degraders promise complementary advantages, such as biocompatibility and sequence programmability. Yet, conventional peptide PROTACs face two persistent limitations: they provide no real-time feedback on degradation dynamics, and they often suffer from limited pharmacokinetic stability.</p> 
<p>To address these challenges, researchers from the Xiaoding Lou Group at the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, developed a covalent self-reporting peptide degrader, Co-SPeD, a modular construct designed to integrate target recognition, covalent stabilization, fluorescence reporting, and E3 ligase recruitment. The design featured four elements: <strong>1|</strong> a peptide ligand for specific protein recognition; <strong>2|</strong> a fluorine-substituted aryl fluorosulfate, FAFS, warhead that undergoes SuFEx chemistry with Lys, His, or Tyr residues; <strong>3|</strong> a computer-screened rotor fluorophore, whose intramolecular rotation is restricted upon protein engagement to yield an “off–on” fluorescence signal; and <strong>4|</strong> a peptide unit to recruit the VHL E3 ligase, thereby initiating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the protein of interest, POI. The consequence is a degrader that first lights up upon binding to the POI and subsequently dims as the POI is destroyed, offering real-time fluorescence feedback on protein fate in cells and <em>in vivo</em>.</p> 
<h3 class=""publication-info"">Design and Mechanism</h3> 
<p>Initial studies employed stilbene-derived rotor fluorophores, R<sub>1–4</sub>, whose emission properties were highly sensitive to viscosity. Docking simulations identified R2 as an optimal module for conjugation with an MDM2-binding peptide, yielding TR2. To further stabilize the probe, the FAFS warhead was incorporated, producing TFR2. Mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, and fluorescence gel imaging confirmed covalent bond formation between TFR2 and MDM2, specifically at the K51 residue. Compared to noncovalent TR2, TFR2 showed enhanced fluorescence response, increased anisotropy, and superior cellular labeling. Importantly, TFR2 selectively illuminated MDM2-high MCF-7 cells, produced negligible background with homologous proteins such as MDMX, and supported imaging of tumor xenografts <em>in vivo</em>.</p> 
<p>Adding a VHL-binding motif to TFR2 created TFR2-P, the full Co-SPeD prototype. In living cells, fluorescence initially increased as TFR2-P engaged MDM2, then declined in parallel with protein degradation. Western blotting confirmed MDM2 depletion and concomitant stabilization of p53. Fluorescence loss was blocked by proteasome inhibition or VHL knockdown, consistent with UPS-mediated degradation. TFR2-P displayed selective cytotoxicity toward MDM2-high tumor cells and suppressed their proliferation. In xenograft models, subcutaneous dosing of TFR2-P reduced tumor burden by 76% without systemic toxicity.</p> 
<h3 class=""publication-info"">Generality Across Targets</h3> 
<p>Beyond MDM2, the Co-SPeD strategy was extended to additional proteins, including BCL-xL, GRP78, and the “undruggable” KRAS(G12D). For each, peptide recognition motifs were combined with distinct rotor fluorophores and the FAFS warhead to create degraders capable of both imaging and depletion. In HeLa, HepG2, and A427 cells, these constructs exhibited concentration-dependent fluorescence decline matched to target knockdown, as well as functional inhibition of downstream signaling such as AKT/ERK phosphorylation in KRAS(G12D) cells. These results underscore the versatility of Co-SPeDs across diverse protein classes, including challenging oncogenic drivers.</p> 
<h3 class=""publication-info"">Therapeutic Implications</h3> 
<p>Real-time visualization of protein degradation was leveraged to optimize combination therapy with cisplatin. In cell culture, cisplatin proved most effective when administered at time points corresponding to minimal MDM2 fluorescence, in essence, after significant target depletion by TFR2-P. Translating this to xenograft models, cisplatin dosing guided by TFR2-P fluorescence monitoring suppressed tumor growth by 95% compared with only 45% inhibition in unguided regimens. These studies demonstrate the potential of Co-SPeDs not only as degraders but as dynamic reporters that can temporally optimize therapeutic interventions.</p> 
<h3 class=""publication-info"">Conclusions</h3> 
<p>The Co-SPeD platform represents a new generation of peptide-based PROTACs that unify target degradation with built-in fluorescence reporting. By exploiting covalent SuFEx chemistry and rotor-fluorophore signaling, these molecules achieve durable protein engagement, selective ubiquitin–proteasome degradation, and live feedback on degradation kinetics. The ability to both destroy and visualize proteins in real time enables rational tuning of combination therapies, as shown with cisplatin, and extends targeted degradation to difficult cancer drivers such as KRAS(G12D). This dual-function design positions Co-SPeDs as powerful tools for chemical biology and therapeutic innovation in precision oncology.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lou_jacs_august_2025.jpg,,A Covalent Self-Reporting Peptide Degrader Enables Real-Time Monitoring of Targeted Protein Degradation <em>In Vivo</em>,"Wei Zhang, Lizhen Yuan, Rui Liu, Yanbo Jing, Shijun Lin, Hao Fang, Yuxuan Li, Xiaohui Zhang, Jun Dai, Tao Liu, Fan Xia, and Xiaoding Lou","<em>J.

In this study, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, by first author Abha Dangi and colleagues in the Del Valle Group at the University of Notre Dame, the team systematically investigate <em>i → i</em>+2 intrastrand cysteine, <i>Cys</i>, stapling as a means to preserve canonical backbone torsions, maintain intact hydrogen-bonding edges, and even modulate amyloidogenic self-assembly — with direct implications for tau protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<h3 class=""publication-info"">A Versatile Stapling Strategy</h3>
<p>The authors selected three distinct peptide systems to probe the effect of <i>Cys</i>-based <em>i → i</em>+2 macrocyclization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BHP-wt — a 12-residue autonomously folding <i>β</i>-hairpin featuring a D-Pro–Gly turn.</p></li>
<li><p>GB1-wt — a 16-residue hairpin from the B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G.</p></li>
<li><p>Tau-wt — a 21-residue <i>β</i>-arch segment from human tau, <sup>294</sup>Lys–<sup>314</sup>Gln, containing the aggregation-prone <sub>306</sub>VQIVYK<sub>311</sub> hexapeptide motif.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, selected <em>i</em> and <em>i</em>+2 positions were mutated to <i>Cys</i>, and the resulting di-Cys variants were cyclized with one of three high-performing bis-electrophiles: E-butenyl, butynyl, or m-xylyl. These were compared with poorly performing controls, for example, thioacetal linkers, to establish the influence of staple geometry on fold stability.</p>

<h3 class=""publication-info"">β-Hairpin Stabilization in Model Systems</h3>
<p>In BHP-wt, di-Cys substitution without stapling reduced folding, as shown by downfield shifts in H<sub>α</sub> resonances at reporter positions. Remarkably, stapling with E-butenyl, butynyl, or m-xylyl not only restored folding but, in some cases, increased the folded population beyond wild-type levels — reaching up to <b>93% folded</b> with a ΔG<sub>fold</sub> shift of −1.46 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>High-resolution <sup>1</sup>H NMR and NOE-restrained structure calculations confirmed antiparallel <i>β</i>-hairpin folds with canonical torsions, robust cross-strand hydrogen-bonding, and linker-dependent side-chain interactions — such as bifurcated H-bonds in VV-btyn and unique CH–π contacts in VV-mxyl.</p>
<p>The GB1-wt system, with longer strands and a different turn motif, showed similar stabilization trends. For both strand positions tested, the same three linkers yielded folded populations ≥88%, confirming that the effect is not limited to a single <i>β</i>-hairpin topology.</p>

<h3 class=""publication-info"">Application to Tau β-Arch Mimics</h3>
<p>Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in microtubule stabilization, signaling, and mRNA translation. In pathological states, misfolding of tau into cross-<i>β</i> amyloid filaments drives neurodegenerative processes. The authors hypothesized that stabilizing a nonaggregation-prone segment of tau’s <i>β</i>-arch, <sup>294</sup>Lys–<sup>300</sup>Val, could promote overall folding into an amyloid-competent conformation.</p>
<p>Three di-Cys tau variants — KN-ns, NK-ns, and KV-ns — were synthesized and stapled with the same three linkers. When tested in tau-YFP biosensor cells, all KV-series staples triggered robust intracellular tau aggregation, visualized as fluorescent puncta. The KV-btyn variant was the most potent seed, and activity was strictly dependent on the precise <em>i → i</em>+2 staple geometry; scrambled <em>i → i</em>+3 controls were inactive.</p>

<h3 class=""publication-info"">Amyloid Self-Assembly and Structural Transitions</h3>
<p><i>In vitro</i>, KV-ebut, KV-btyn, and KV-mxyl exhibited high Thioflavin T fluorescence within hours, indicating rapid fibril formation. CD spectroscopy revealed a transition from random coil (monomer) to parallel <i>β</i>-sheet, fibril, signatures after incubation in phosphate-buffered saline.</p>
<p>Negative-stain TEM confirmed the presence of short, filamentous aggregates for stapled variants, while tau-wt showed no aggregates. Interestingly, the PHF6 hexapeptide formed fibrils but could not seed tau in cells — emphasizing that amyloidogenicity and seeding competence are distinct properties influenced by <i>β</i>-arch context.</p>

<h3 class=""publication-info"">Conclusions and Outlook</h3>
<p>This work demonstrates that <em>i → i</em>+2 intrastrand di-Cys stapling, with judiciously chosen linkers, is a powerful and synthetically accessible approach to stabilize <i>β</i>-sheet folds. Beyond model peptides, it can impart amyloidogenic self-assembly and prion-like seeding capability to otherwise nonaggregation-prone sequences.</p>
<p>Because the staples preserve backbone hydrogen-bonding edges — a key recognition surface in <i>β</i>-sheet PPIs — this strategy holds promise for designing minimalistic <i>β</i>-strand mimics that target disease-relevant aggregation pathways or disrupt pathogenic PPIs. Coupled with the established benefits of stapling for proteolytic stability and membrane permeability, these findings open a versatile platform for both fundamental <i>β</i>-sheet design and therapeutic intervention.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/del_valle_jacs_aug_2025.jpg,,"Intrastrand Peptide Staples That Promote β-Sheet Folding, Self-Assembly, and Amyloid Seeding","Abha Dangi, Isaac J.

20126,Allosteric Turns,9/4/25 12:34,Ivo E.,Sampaio-Dias,Ph.D.,University of Porto,,Allosteric Turns,"Disorders of the central nervous system linked to dysregulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors — including depression, drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and movement disorders — remain challenging to treat with selectivity...","<p>Disorders of the central nervous system linked to dysregulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors — including depression, drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and movement disorders — remain challenging to treat with selectivity. While most known allosteric modulators of G protein–coupled receptors are synthetic, the tripeptide melanostatin, MIF-1; Pro–Leu–Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>, stands out as the only endogenous positive allosteric modulator, PAM, with specificity for the D<sub>2</sub> receptor. First isolated from hypothalamic extracts in 1971, MIF-1 potentiates dopamine agonist binding in an inverted-U concentration–response profile, yet its biosynthesis, bioactive conformation, and structural pharmacophore remain incompletely defined. Importantly, the l-proline residue in MIF-1 has long been suspected to play a critical role in adopting a type II β-turn conformation thought to underlie its activity.</p>
<p>To probe these structural determinants, researchers from the Sampaio-Dias Lab at the University of Porto, LAQV-REQUIMTE, in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Santiago de Compostela, published in <em>ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters</em>, synthesized and evaluated a series of l-pipecolyl-based MIF-1 analogues, substituting proline with the six-membered pipecolic acid scaffold and introducing variations at the C-terminal functional group. The synthetic route employed standard peptide coupling, Boc deprotection, and amidation steps to yield a small focused library including compound 1, ipecolyl–Leu–Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>, and compound 9, pipecolyl–Leu–Gly-OMe, with full characterization by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>When tested in functional assays at human D<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed in CHO cells, the analogues showed divergent effects on dopamine potency. At subnanomolar concentrations, 0.01 nM, compound 1 modestly increased dopamine potency, 1.8-fold, while compound 9 matched or exceeded the activity of MIF-1 itself, 4.1-fold. At 1 nM, MIF-1 activity declined and compound 1 lost activity altogether, but compound 9 retained robust PAM activity, shifting the dopamine EC50 more than four-fold without altering maximal efficacy. Control compounds containing carbamate substitutions were inactive, highlighting the importance of the amide-to-ester isosteric replacement in conferring activity.</p>
<p>Mechanistic studies confirmed that neither 1 nor 9 acted as intrinsic agonists, supporting a bona fide PAM mechanism. <em>In silico</em> calculations suggested that 1 preferentially adopts β-turn conformations, while 9 favors γ-turns due to the absence of a C-terminal carboxamide hydrogen bond donor. Cytotoxicity assays in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells showed that both compounds were non-toxic at concentrations up to 100 μM, comparable to the parent peptide.</p>
<p>Taken together, this work demonstrates that homologation of proline with pipecolic acid is compatible with D<sub>2</sub> receptor PAM activity, and that an amide-to-ester substitution can not only be tolerated but also enhance potency. The findings challenge prior assumptions that β-turn conformations are strictly required for activity and instead point to alternative structural solutions, including γ-turn motifs. By revealing flexible pharmacophore requirements for MIF-1 derivatives, this study provides valuable structure–activity relationship insights and identifies compound 9 as a promising lead for the rational design of novel anti-Parkinson’s drug candidates.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sampaio_dias_acs_med_chem.jpg,"<p class=""small"">Optimized geometries of <strong>1|A</strong> and <strong>9|B</strong> at the PBE0/6–31G(d,p) level of theory in implicit water using the IEFPCM solvation model, exhibiting a type I′ β-turn and a classical γ-turn, respectively, assisted by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, dashed black lines.</p>",Proline Homologation in Melanostatin Neuropeptide: Discovery of Potent Modulators of the Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> Receptors,"Ivo E.

20082,Peptide Galanin Binding,8/3/25 15:09,Samarjit,Patnaik,Chemistry Group Leader,National Institutes of Health,,Peptide Galanin Binding,"In a landmark study, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, researchers from the Samarjit Patnaik group at the National Institutes of Health, report the development of a live-cell NanoBRET, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer, assay...","<p>Galanin, a neuroendocrine peptide widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, regulates diverse physiological functions such as energy balance, mood, pain, and neuroendocrine signaling. These functions are mediated via three G protein-coupled receptor, GPCR, subtypes—GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Traditional methods for characterizing ligand-receptor interactions, such as radioligand binding assays, have proven limited by safety constraints, low throughput, and an artificial, membrane-isolated context. In a landmark study, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, researchers from the Samarjit Patnaik group at the National Institutes of Health, report the development of a live-cell NanoBRET, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer, assay targeting GALR1, utilizing novel fluorescent peptide tracers derived from galanin, Gal(1–15), and M40 peptides.</p>
<p>The NanoBRET assay centers on a HiBiT-tagged GALR1 receptor expressed on HEK293 cells. Upon complementation with LgBiT, the donor luciferase generates bioluminescence on addition of furimazine substrate. When a fluorescently labeled ligand tracer binds in close proximity, <10 nm, resonance energy transfer yields a BRET signal. This system allows ratiometric quantification of ligand-receptor interactions in real time within intact cellular environments.</p>
<p>To construct compatible tracers, group members synthesized six peptide-fluorophore conjugates by attaching BODIPY-based NanoBRET 590 dyes to either native lysine residues or synthetic C-terminal lysines. These were derived from full-length galanin, 30 aa, Gal(1–15), 15aa, and M40, 20aa, each modified with two linker lengths to optimize energy transfer geometry. Tracers were rigorously characterized using LC/MS, radioligand competition assays, and multiple functional cellular readouts.</p>
<p>All six tracers demonstrated agonist activity in a β-arrestin recruitment assay, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6–33 nM. M40-derived tracers exhibited the highest potency, while Gal(1–15)-derived tracers showed moderate affinity. Binding saturation assays revealed a clear length-dependent decrease in BRET signal intensity—shorter peptides, Gal(1–15), yielded stronger signals, likely due to favorable donor–acceptor spatial orientation.</p>
<p>NanoBRET-derived equilibrium dissociation constants, K_D, ranged from ~10 to ~190 nM, closely aligned with kinetic values derived from real-time association/dissociation curves. M40 tracers had the strongest binding affinity, K_D ~10–18 nM, and tracer residence times ranged from 11 to 46 minutes, underscoring the assay's utility in kinetic profiling.</p>
<p>To validate tracer specificity, displacement assays were conducted with a panel of ten unmodified galanin-derived peptides. Affinities, K_i, spanned four orders of magnitude, with peptides like M15, M35, and galanin showing nanomolar potency, while truncated or modified sequences, for example, Gal(2–11), Gal(DMG,2–15), showed minimal or no binding. Notably, the NanoBRET assay reliably ranked ligand affinities consistent with historical radioligand data, but with expected right-shifts due to live-cell context and possible serum peptide sequestration.</p>
<p>Tracers also bound effectively to GALR2, though GALR3 saturation was not observed—likely due to poor receptor surface expression. Correlation analyses between BRET binding data and β-arrestin EC<sub>50</sub> values confirmed strong alignment between binding and functional activation across peptide variants.</p>
<p>A complementary HiBiT-GALR1 internalization assay provided additional functional validation. Decreased luminescence upon ligand-induced endocytosis indicated receptor activation. Potent ligands such as M15 and M35 induced robust internalization, while others, for example, Gal(1–15), M617, showed moderate effects. Interestingly, M40 acted as a partial agonist in this assay—contrasting with its full agonist behavior in β-arrestin recruitment and its classical designation as an antagonist—highlighting potential functional selectivity.</p>
<p>Tracers were further benchmarked in radioligand displacement assays using [<sup>3</sup>H]galanin. Results showed strong concordance with NanoBRET-derived affinities, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.845. However, the authors argue convincingly for the superiority of NanoBRET in live-cell pharmacology: unlike radioligand assays, NanoBRET preserves native receptor architecture, G-protein and ion allosteric modulators, and membrane lipid context. This enables more physiologically relevant insights into ligand behavior, especially for peptide GPCRs like GALR1.</p>
<p>This study establishes a robust, scalable NanoBRET assay system for monitoring galanin–GALR1 interactions in live cells. The six engineered peptide-based tracers provide tools for quantifying binding affinities, kinetics, receptor internalization, and functional activity with high precision and biological relevance. These results underscore the broader applicability of peptide-based NanoBRET tracers in GPCR pharmacology and reinforce the central role of live-cell assay systems in the rational design of neuropeptide therapeutics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/patnaik_aqcs_chem_biology_jul_2025.jpg,"<p class=""small""><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Schematic of the NanoBRET-based target engagement assay.

Her talk built directly upon her recent publication in <em><a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.5c00183"" target=""_blank"">Biochemistry</a></em>, which laid out a sweeping framework for understanding how phosphatases, those long-overlooked counterparts to kinases, are regulated, how they recognize their substrates, and how they can now be approached as druggable targets.</p>
<p>For decades, the field has wrestled with the frustrating reality that phosphatases are, by design, difficult to target. Unlike kinases, whose deep catalytic pockets lend themselves well to small molecule inhibition, phosphatases often operate through broad, shallow protein-protein interfaces. These interactions are essential for their function as holoenzymes, complex molecular assemblies in which a catalytic subunit is scaffolded by regulatory proteins. It is precisely this complexity that has made them so resistant to traditional drug discovery efforts.</p>

	<p class=""small""><strong>Figure</strong> Substrate identification and recruitment to PP1c. <strong>A|</strong> Possible effects on phosphorylation sites induced by the addition of PP1 disrupting peptide, PDP, or PhosTAP to cell lysates. As PDP is cell permeable, phosphorylation level changes can be monitored in intact cells, enabling monitoring of downstream signaling pathways. Direct and indirect events can be disentangled by measuring direct dephosphorylation events in cell lysates. <strong>B|</strong> Mechanism proposed by Yan et al. for substrate recruitment and eIF2α pSer51 dephosphorylation. G-actin stabilizes the alpha-helices in the C-terminus of R15A for the positioning of eIF2α-NTD, whereas the distal complexed protein eIF2γ is required for substrate recruitment. </p>
</div>	
<p>Köhn’s work reframes this challenge as an opportunity, pointing to peptides, and their engineered derivatives, as uniquely suited tools for modulating phosphatase activity. Peptides are inherently capable of engaging large surface areas and can be designed to mimic, disrupt, or stabilize the kinds of transient interactions that define holoenzyme architecture. Her lab’s work has shown that it is possible not only to inhibit key phosphatase interactions but also to fine-tune them, guiding their assembly, substrate specificity, and even catalytic output.</p>
<p>Professor Köhn's research highlights a series of mechanistic breakthroughs that have rapidly reshaped the field. In the case of PP1, recent studies reveal that substrate recognition often extends beyond canonical short linear motifs, involving distal proteins that effectively serve as molecular scaffolds for recruitment. The discovery that the regulatory protein PPP1R15A recruits the PP1 substrate eIF2α through a two-site mechanism, one involving direct binding to the catalytic subunit, the other mediated by a distant interaction with eIF2γ, has fundamentally changed how scientists think about phosphatase targeting.</p>
<p>Similar paradigm shifts are unfolding in the study of PP2A holoenzymes. While it was once assumed that most phosphatase–substrate interactions were mediated by simple linear motifs, recent structural work has revealed that PP2A:B55 complexes rely on a different recognition strategy entirely, one based on short helical motifs rather than linear sequences. This discovery not only explains why earlier attempts to predict substrates from sequence data often failed but also opens the door to a new class of peptide-based inhibitors and modulators specifically designed to engage these structured interfaces.</p>
<p>Köhn’s group has extended these concepts beyond PP1 and PP2A to PP5, a particularly intriguing member of the phosphatase family that regulates the stress response and protein quality control through an autoinhibitory mechanism involving its tetratricopeptide, TPR, domain. Her work has contributed to the emerging understanding of how PP5’s interactions with chaperones like HSP90 and CDC37 regulate both its activation and its substrate specificity, offering yet another example of how peptide-based tools can be leveraged to dissect, and ultimately control, complex phosphatase signaling networks.</p>
<p>Throughout her San Diego presentation, Köhn emphasized that while phosphatases have traditionally been viewed as intractable targets, the problem has always been one of tool design, not biology. Peptides, with their inherent ability to bridge large, complex protein surfaces, are not simply workarounds for difficult targets—they are, in many cases, the ideal modality for interrogating and manipulating the dynamic assemblies that define phosphatase function.</p>
<p>Her lab’s work in designing phosphomimetics, photoactivatable peptides, and PPI disruptors underscores this point. These tools have revealed unexpected insights, including cases where binding affinities or biochemical outcomes diverge from classical predictions. Such surprises are not setbacks but rather opportunities, offering deeper understanding of the fluid, adaptable logic by which these enzymes operate within the cell.</p>
<p>It was particularly fitting that this talk came on the heels of her landmark 2025 publication, as the two formed a seamless narrative arc. The paper laid the conceptual and structural groundwork; the San Diego presentation brought it vividly to life. Together, they reflect a field not merely advancing incrementally but undergoing a profound conceptual transformation. What was once deemed undruggable is now revealed to be exquisitely tunable—provided the right molecular language is spoken.</p>
<p>In Köhn’s hands, that language is peptide-based, structurally precise, and chemically sophisticated. Her work stands as a compelling demonstration that the future of phosphatase biology—and perhaps of many other so-called ""undruggable"" targets—will be written not in small molecules alone, but in the versatile and expanding vocabulary of peptides and phosphomimetics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kohn_biochemistry_june_2025.jpg,,The Fascinating Intricacy of pSer/Thr-Specific Phosphatases and Their Higher-Order Complexes: Emerging Concepts,Laura Scheinost and Maja Köhn,"<em>Biochemistry</em>, <strong>2025</strong>, 64, 12, 2506–2515",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.5c00183?,,,,,,,,protein-phosphorylation,8/1/25 16:16

In an innovative and collaborative study, researchers from the Wu group at the Xiamen University, Yin group at the Shandong University's Institute of Microbial Technology, and Tsai group at the Institute of Molecular Physiology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, published in <em>J.A.C.S.</em>, present a proline-scanning strategy that enhances the evolvability of DRP scaffolds by promoting structural separation between rigid ""scaffold"" residues and mutable ""nonscaffold"" regions.

<p class=""small""><strong>Figure 1.</strong>Proline scanning to enhance the evolvability of disulfide-rich peptides, DRPs. <strong>a|</strong> Strategic incorporation of prolines as scaffold residues enhances the polarity of DRPs, thereby improving robustness and innovability to enhance their evolvability. <strong>b|</strong> Proline-scanning mutagenesis was conducted on loops 1 to 3 of the wild-type ω-MVIIA peptide, introducing proline residues at suitable positions to increase the peptide’s tolerance to sequence variations. Additionally, random amino acid elongation was performed in loop 4 to expand the sequence space. Following these modifications, an mRNA-displayed peptide library was designed to discover high-affinity peptide binders, followed by construction of a phage library from the recovered cDNA to improve the folding efficiency of the peptide binders.</p>
</div>
<p>Inspired by the unique conformational rigidity of proline, the team introduced up to seven additional proline residues into the inhibitor cystine knot, ICK, fold. These substitutions increased peptide folding efficiency dramatically, exceeding 90% in optimized variants, while maintaining structural integrity. Nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, confirmed that even heavily proline-engineered DRPs preserved core topologies and introduced new scaffold polarity, enabling extensive sequence diversification without compromising foldability.</p>
<p>By integrating mRNA and phage display, researchers screened libraries of proline-engineered ICKs against key targets including TROP2, a tumor-associated antigen, and 4-1BB, a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor. The peptides identified showed high oxidative folding yields and low-nanomolar binding affinities, as low as 7.0 nM. Structural studies revealed novel disulfide pairing topologies and 3D folds, underscoring the capacity of these engineered DRPs to adopt entirely new architectures and functions.</p>
<p>The team demonstrated the therapeutic potential of DRPs by incorporating the TROP2-binding peptide pCT2 into a chimeric antigen receptor, CAR, construct. Compared to traditional scFv-based CARs, pCT2-CAR T cells selectively killed TROP2-overexpressing cancer cells while sparing cells with low antigen expression—greatly reducing off-tumor toxicity. These DRP-based CARs also secreted lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a safer profile with diminished risk of cytokine release syndrome.</p>
<p>This study introduces proline scanning as a powerful tool for engineering DRPs with enhanced structural polarity, folding efficiency, and functional diversity. By resolving the long-standing tradeoff between peptide rigidity and flexibility, the approach opens the door to next-generation cyclic peptides for drug discovery, immunotherapy, and beyond. The fusion of rational scaffold design with high-throughput screening platforms represents a major leap forward in modular, evolvable peptide therapeutics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wu_yin_tsai_etal_jacs_jul_2025.jpg,,Proline-Mediated Enhancement in Evolvability of Disulfide-Rich Peptides for Discovering Protein Binders,"Hongtan Liu, Lulu Song, Xiaoting Meng, Jinjing Li, Shihui Fan, Huilei Dong, Xiaoran Wang, Maolin Li, Haipeng Yu, Yu-Hsuan Tsai, Yizhen Yin, and Chuanliu Wu","<em>J.

However, despite numerous investigations using molecular dynamics, MD, and quantum mechanical, QM, calculations, a rigorous, experimentally anchored picture of its backbone structure in aqueous solution remains unresolved. In a forthcoming study in <em>Biochemistry</em>, researchers from <a href=""https://chemistry.nd.edu/people/anthony-serianni/"" target=""_blank"">Professor Anthony Serianni's Lab</a> at the University of Notre Dame apply the <em>MA’AT</em> method, named after the Egyptian goddess of truth, Ma’at, to extract conformational distributions from redundant NMR scalar, <em>J</em>, couplings. Originally developed for saccharides, this marks the first application of MA’AT to peptide analysis.</p>
<p>To perform this analysis, a series of <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled isotopomers of <strong>1</strong> were synthesized, and a comprehensive set of scalar couplings sensitive to backbone torsion angles φ, C<sub>b</sub>–N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>, and ψ, N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>–N<sub>d</sub>, were measured via high-resolution NMR. These experimental values were then paired with DFT-calculated Karplus-like equations, parameterized from four distinct functional/basis set combinations and filtered for low-energy structures. The resulting coupling functions were fed into the MA’AT statistical framework, which computes angular probability distributions by minimizing deviations between experimental and predicted <em>J</em> values. The resulting solution-state models were benchmarked against 1 μs of explicit-solvent MD simulations using the AMBER FF19SB force field.</p>
<p><em>MA’AT</em> analysis of the φ torsion angle yielded a well-defined, unimodal angular distribution centered around 299°, with a circular standard deviation, CSD, of approximately 44°. This solution-derived distribution closely aligned with the MD-determined mean of 288°, though the <em>MA’AT</em> model exhibited a superior fit to experimental data, RMSD = 0.47 Hz versus 1.13 Hz for MD. These results point to dominant solution conformations that reside within the C<sub>7</sub><sup>eq</sup> and α<sub>R</sub> regions of φ/ψ space, with minor contributions from C<sub>5</sub>-like geometries. The reliability of this one-state φ model underscores the utility of redundant scalar coupling data and robust DFT parameterization in characterizing peptide backbone geometry in solution.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ψ angle proved more challenging to resolve. The available ψ-sensitive couplings—including vicinal, geminal, and one-bond interactions—exhibited modest dynamic ranges and were affected by secondary dependencies on φ. Nonetheless, the researchers in the Serianni Lab succeeded in constructing two-state ψ models using <em>MA’AT</em> by constraining angular dispersion, CSD, values during statistical modeling. The best-fitting two-state model featured distributions centered near 169° and 302°, in good agreement with the MD-derived ψ means of 119° and 309°. While neither solution model precisely replicated the MD results, both matched reasonably well in terms of population ratios, approximately 60:40, and demonstrated the feasibility of modeling multistate ψ equilibria from experimental data. The use of one-bond couplings, <sup>1</sup><em>J</em><sub>Cc,Hc</sub> and <sup>1</sup><em>J</em><sub>Cc,Cf</sub> proved critical in enabling these multistate fits.</p>
<p>In addition to φ and ψ, the members of the Serianni group also addressed the amide bond configurations ω<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>a</sub>–C<sub>b</sub>–N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>, and ω<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>–N<sub>d</sub>–C<sub>e</sub>, which can in principle adopt <em>cis</em> or <em>trans</em> geometries. By comparing three <em>J</em>-couplings per amide bond to values predicted by DFT for <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em> configurations, the study confirmed a strong preference for the <em>trans</em> conformation in both cases. This result is consistent with expected kinetic barriers and supports the assumption that the amide linkages in <strong>1</strong> are conformationally restricted on the NMR timescale.</p>
<p>In summary, this work extends <em>MA’AT</em> analysis beyond carbohydrates and into the peptide realm, offering an experimental route to solution-phase backbone modeling. The φ torsion angle, supported by a wealth of <em>J</em>-coupling data and high-quality DFT parameterization, can be characterized with high confidence. Although ψ analysis remains more uncertain due to limited data and weaker torsion-coupling relationships, this study demonstrates that constrained multistate modeling can still provide informative insights. The authors note that future improvements in DFT-calculated one-bond couplings and expanded experimental coupling datasets will be essential for achieving high-precision ψ modeling in peptides and proteins. Ultimately, the application of <em>MA’AT</em> to peptide systems like alanine dipeptide marks a meaningful advance toward accurate, experimentally driven conformational analysis of biomolecules in solution.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/serianno_biochem_jul_2025.jpg,,MA’AT Analysis of Peptides: Conformational Equilibrium of Alanine Dipeptide in Aqueous Solution,"Jieye Lin, Reagan J.

In a groundbreaking collaborative study, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the Craik, Chan, and Gachon Groups at the University of Queensland, report the development of a next-generation antiobesity peptide therapeutic—PTP-r—designed to target white adipose tissue, WAT, by homing in on the mitochondrial prohibitin, PHB, protein.</p>
<p>Derived from the chimeric peptide prohibitin-TP01, PTP, the newly engineered PTP-r incorporates <span style=""font-size: .6em"">D</span>-arginine substitutions into the proapoptotic KLAK motif to enhance peptide stability, mitochondrial localization, and lipid-disruptive activity. The result is a potent compound that induces mitochondrial uncoupling and drives significant weight loss in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, all while exhibiting excellent safety profiles in preclinical models.</p>
<p>PTP-r binds preferentially to phosphatidylserine, PS-rich, membranes—abundant in WAT and mitochondrial inner membranes—showing selective internalization into adipocytes and effective disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Structure–activity relationship studies confirmed that <span style=""font-size: .6em"">D</span>-amino acid incorporation prolongs peptide stability in serum and enhances helical structure integrity upon membrane engagement.</p>
<p>Treatment with PTP-r not only reduced lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes but also induced sex-specific metabolic changes. RNA-sequencing revealed upregulation of browning-associated genes, for example, <em>Ucp1, Ppargc1a, Cidea</em>, in female WAT, along with activation of mitochondrial stress signaling via the cGAS-STING pathway, particularly in male liver tissue. This dual action points to a nuanced, sex-dependent mechanism involving mitochondrial remodeling and immune signaling.</p>
<p>Subcutaneous administration of PTP-r led to rapid and sustained body weight reduction in obese mice without changes in food intake or liver toxicity. Treated animals exhibited smaller adipocytes and reduced WAT mass, supporting the peptide’s ability to mitigate fat expansion while preserving metabolic tissue health.</p>
<p>This work highlights PTP-r as a promising mitochondria-targeted peptide therapeutic capable of modulating adipocyte biology and systemic metabolism. Through rational design and biochemical fine-tuning, the study opens new avenues for safe, peptide-based interventions in obesity and metabolic syndrome, with the potential for precision application across sex-specific physiological contexts.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/craik_etal_jacs_july_2025.jpg,,Mixed-Chirality Prohibitin Peptide: D-(RLARLAR)2 Enhances Stability and <em>In Vivo</em> Effects on Obesity,"Lai Yue Chan, Benjamin D.

Antibody-based CD47 blockade, though effective, is clinically constrained by off-target toxicity, most notably anemia, due to widespread CD47 expression on red blood cells. To address this, researchers from the Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine and the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development in Shanghai, China, report in the <em>Journal of American Chemical Society</em>, the development of a novel peptide-based lysosome-targeting chimera, LYTAC, termed RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>, which selectively degrades CD47 in tumor cells via the lysosomal pathway without affecting erythrocytes.</p>
<p>RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> consists of a CD47-binding peptide, RS17, conjugated to a tri-valent mannose-6-phosphate, M6P<sub>3</sub>, moiety for recruitment of cation-independent M6P receptors, CI-M6PR. This targeted degradation mechanism circumvents the limitations of conventional receptor-occupancy-based therapies. The study confirmed dose- and time-dependent CD47 degradation in B16F10 melanoma and other tumor cell lines, with minimal off-target effects on RBCs due to their lack of lysosomes. Mechanistic studies using fluorescence microscopy and lysosomal inhibitors validated the selective lysosomal trafficking and degradation of CD47.</p>
<p>In macrophage co-culture assays, RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> significantly enhanced phagocytosis of tumor cells compared to CD47-blocking peptides alone, demonstrating superior functional efficacy. Importantly, RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> did not induce hemolysis or macrophage uptake of RBCs, affirming its hematologic safety.</p>
<p>To further potentiate the immune response, the study integrates <em>Polyporus</em> polysaccharide, PPS, a natural immunomodulator that reprograms tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs, from the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype to the tumoricidal M1 phenotype. PPS not only inhibited M2 polarization but also upregulated M1-associated genes and phagocytic activity in both naïve and polarized macrophages. The synergistic combination of RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> and PPS amplified tumor cell phagocytosis <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
<p>This dual-action strategy was encapsulated in a biodegradable microneedle, MN, platform, PPS/RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>@MN, enabling localized transdermal delivery. Mechanical and dissolution analyses confirmed optimal performance for dermal penetration and payload release. In murine melanoma models, PPS/RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>@MN treatment led to significant tumor growth inhibition, elevated CD4+/CD8+ T-cell infiltration, M1-biased TAM repolarization, and decreased tumor proliferation and viability, without inducing systemic toxicity or hematological abnormalities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 antibodies showed additive tumor regression and improved survival, supporting the compatibility of this LYTAC platform with current checkpoint inhibitors. Intravenous administration of RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> in breast cancer models also demonstrated favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, highlighting its versatility and translational promise.</p>
<p>This is the first demonstration of a peptide-based LYTAC integrated with a natural immunomodulator in a dissolvable MN system, offering a potent, dual-modality therapeutic platform that simultaneously targets immune checkpoints and reconditions the tumor microenvironment. The findings support broader application of LYTAC technologies in safe, selective, and effective cancer immunotherapy.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/luan_zhang_etal_jacs_jul_2025.jpg,,Delivery of Peptide-LYTAC via Polyporus Polysaccharide Microneedles for Targeted CD47 Degradation and Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy,"Jiayi Lin, Xiaokun Zhang, Aoyu Cheng, Maomao Ren, Xiaopan Yao, Xin Sun, Rui Liang, Shengxin Lu, Long Gao, Yajie Kan, Bei Wang, Ye Wu, Hongzhuan Chen, Weidong Zhang, and Xin Luan","<em>J.

However, conventional approaches to peptide-based self-assembly are often constrained by environmental sensitivity, polymorphic behavior, and limited structural control. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the Binju Wang and Tao Jiang groups at the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University, China, introduce a robust scaffold-mediated strategy that overcomes these limitations by covalently organizing coiled-coil peptides into trifaceted cyclic scaffolds, enabling programmable and predictable assembly into diverse nanostructures.</p>
<p>The authors constructed cyclic trimers comprising orthogonal coiled-coil dimers—23-mer peptides, <strong>1 & 2</strong>, and 30-mer peptides, <strong>3 & 4</strong>, linked via disulfide and CuAAC-mediated cross-links. The resulting scaffold <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> displayed three outward-facing binding interfaces and preserved the helical conformation and specificity of its component dimers, as confirmed by CD, SEC, SV-AUC, and MALDI-MS analyses. Upon coassembly with matching peptides <strong>2</strong> and <strong>4</strong>, scaffold <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> formed a discrete triangular nanostructure, <strong>S<sub>12,34,34</sub></strong>, validated by synchrotron SAXS, <em>ab initio</em> shape reconstructions, DAMMIF, GASBOR, and site-specific AuNP labeling imaged by TEM. The measured geometric parameters were in excellent agreement with theoretical models and all-atom MD simulations.</p>
<p>By combining complementary scaffolds with varied peptide orientations, <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> and <strong>S<sub>2,4,4</sub></strong>, the authors achieved 2D lamellar assemblies. SAXS, AFM, and TEM analyses revealed the gradual transformation from ribbons to monolayer sheets over time, driven by directional stability differences between edge pairs, 3/4 vs. 1/2. MD simulations further supported the observed assembly anisotropy.</p>
<p>To tune dimensionality and curvature, the team selectively blocked one edge with a free peptide, for example peptide <strong>2</strong>, to favor 1D fibril formation. Incorporating modified scaffolds, <strong>M<sub>1,3′,3′</sub></strong> and <strong>L<sub>1,3″,3″</sub></strong>, in which the cross-linking positions were progressively shifted toward the interior of peptide <strong>3</strong>, induced controlled curvature in fibrillar assemblies. TEM, AFM, and MD analyses demonstrated increasing curvature values from scaffold <strong>S</strong>, straight, to <strong>M</strong>, moderate, to <strong>L</strong>, high curvature, with Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, confirming corresponding conformational changes.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that scaffold plasticity plays a critical role in adaptive assembly behavior. Scaffold flexibility, primarily encoded in linker regions, allowed conformational expansion or contraction depending on assembly context. The ability to adopt planar or contracted shapes enabled the same scaffold to participate in structurally distinct assemblies while maintaining directional binding fidelity.</p>
<p>This work establishes scaffold-guided coiled-coil assembly as a powerful and generalizable method to direct nanoscale structure formation under uniform conditions. The predictability, modularity, and conformational adaptability of these trifaceted scaffolds represent a conceptual advance in peptide nanotechnology. Beyond triangular and sheet morphologies, this platform can be extended to higher-order architectures through orthogonal peptide integration, hierarchical design, or the incorporation of other bio- or synthetic macromolecular motifs. These findings open new possibilities for rational design of complex, functional biomaterials with controlled geometry and emergent properties.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wang_jian_etal_jacs_jun_2025.jpg,,Shaping Peptide Assemblies Using Multifaceted Cyclic Tectons,"Chenru Wang, Dexin Lu, Jiakang Li, Linyuan Chen, Xiaobing Zuo, Chuanliu Wu, Xian-Kui Wei, Binju Wang, Yun-Bao Jiang, and Tao Jiang","<em>J.

Coacervate-based systems offer a promising platform, yet many are hampered by instability in physiological conditions and diminished performance in serum-containing media. In this study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, by researchers from the Futaki Group at Kyoto University, present a refined, polysaccharide-based microcondensate system that significantly enhances the intracellular delivery efficiency of immunoglobulin G, IgG, antibodies while reducing the required dosage.</p>
<p>Building on prior work utilizing pullulan conjugates with membrane-permeabilizing peptides, notably L17E and M-lycotoxin, the investigators synthesized a suite of new delivery vectors by conjugating pullulan to M-lycotoxin peptides bearing 2–8 terminal arginine residues, PL-MLTXRn. These arginine modifications were designed to strengthen membrane interaction, coacervate formation, and cellular uptake.</p>
<p>Among the variants, PL-MLTXR4, bearing four arginines, demonstrated optimal performance. Compared to the unmodified PL-MLTX, the PL-MLTXR4 system achieved cytosolic IgG delivery to ~70% of HeLa cells at only 10 μg/mL IgG, AF488, and ~85% at 20 μg/mL — representing a threefold reduction in required antibody concentration for comparable efficacy. The delivery process was rapid, with cytosolic dispersion observed within 1 minute of microcondensate-cell contact. Notably, PL-MLTXR4 microcondensates maintained structural stability and activity in serum-containing media, an essential criterion for <em>in vivo</em> applications.</p>
<p>Liposome leakage assays confirmed enhanced membrane-disrupting capabilities for PL-MLTXR4 compared to its unmodified counterpart. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the microcondensates formed discrete, stable particles capable of penetrating various cell lines, including A549, HT1080, and MIA PaCa-2, with significantly higher delivery efficiencies than PL-MLTX alone. Importantly, delivered IgG retained biological function, as shown by anti-nuclear pore complex antibodies targeting the nuclear envelope post-delivery.</p>
<p>This work validates the PL-MLTXR4-based microcondensate system as a robust, efficient, and scalable method for intracellular IgG delivery, offering significant advantages in terms of dose economy, speed, and bioactivity preservation. These findings support the future development of arginine-tuned coacervate platforms for therapeutic protein delivery and intracellular targeting applications.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/futaki_bioconjugate_chem_july_25.jpg,,Addition of Oligoarginine to a Membrane Permeabilizing Peptide M-Lycotoxin Facilitates Intracellular Antibody Infusion from Microcondensate,"Junya Michibata, Yoshimasa Kawaguchi, Yusei Furuyama, Yoshihiro Sasaki, Kazunari Akiyoshi, and Shiroh Futaki","<em>Bioconjugate Chem</em>, <strong>2025</strong>, 02 July, retrieved online",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5c00176,,,,,,,,intracellular-targeting,7/15/25 14:57

In this study, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers in the Gellman Lab at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, reports the successful engineering of a highly specific aab heterotrimer derived from the well-characterized foldon homotrimer of bacteriophage T4 fibritin. By strategically destabilizing homotrimeric associations and exploiting complementary hydrophobic interactions, the authors demonstrate that quantitative native mass spectrometry, MS, can be used not merely as an analytical technique but as a decisive design tool.</p>

<p>The native foldon motif, a 27-residue trimeric β-propeller-like scaffold, is widely employed in vaccine and biomaterial development. Its inherent sensitivity to sequence perturbations makes it an ideal platform for engineering alternative oligomeric states. The authors initiated their design with two targeted mutations: Q11E, to introduce electrostatic repulsion between subunits and destabilize the native homotrimer, and V14A or V14L, to adjust the size of the hydrophobic core. By combining variants with either smaller, Ala, or larger, Leu, side chains at position 14, the authors hypothesized that a favorable packing interaction in a heterotrimeric configuration could be achieved.</p>
<p>Native MS served as the pivotal tool throughout this process, enabling precise deconvolution of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric species and quantification of equilibrium distributions in solution. When a 2:1 mixture of G1K-Q11E-V14A and G1K-Q11E-V14L was thermocycled and analyzed by MS, a dominant aab heterotrimer population, >80%, emerged, far exceeding the statistical expectation. This compositional preference was confirmed both by gas-phase dissociation experiments and by high-resolution X-ray crystallography of crystals grown from the same 2:1 mixture. The resolved heterotrimer structure, PDB: 8UDN, maintained a foldon-like tertiary architecture with key differences in side-chain packing, supporting the hypothesis that selective assembly was driven by steric complementarity and Coulombic destabilization of competing forms.</p>
<p>Control experiments revealed that both the Q11E substitution and the V14A/V14L pairing were necessary for selective heterotrimer formation; removing the Q11E mutation significantly diminished the aab preference. Interestingly, crystallographic data showed that the Glu11 side chains did not participate in direct intersubunit repulsion, suggesting instead that intramolecular strain between Glu11 and Asp9 may play a destabilizing role.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates the remarkable utility of native MS in guiding multistep design processes for complex protein architectures. Unlike traditional structural biology techniques that require high-resolution structural snapshots, native MS offers rapid, solution-phase readouts of dynamic equilibrium states and subunit stoichiometries. By pairing this analytical precision with rational design principles, the authors provide a compelling proof-of-concept for expanding the repertoire of oligomeric protein structures beyond classical coiled-coils and triple helices.</p>
<p>This study establishes foldon-based heterotrimers as a novel design space for programmable protein scaffolds and exemplifies the use of native MS as a forward-looking tool for synthetic biology, molecular engineering, and biomaterial design.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gellman_jacs_july_2025_1.jpg,,Rational Design of a Foldon-Derived Heterotrimer Guided by Quantitative Native Mass Spectrometry,"Xinyu Liu, David S.

<p>The team, which also includes the <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/challis-lab"" target=""_blank"">Challis</a> and <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/cryle-lab"" target=""_blank"">Cryle</a> groups at Monash University in Australia, identified a conserved FHAFRF motif within a group of RiPP precursor peptides encoded biosynthetic gene clusters, BGCs, that encode in multinuclear nonheme iron-dependent oxidative enzymes, MNIOs. Focusing on one such BGC from <em>Peribacillus simplex</em>, designated the pbs cluster, they reconstructed the pathway in <em>E. coli</em> and characterized the activities of five distinct enzymes: a MNIO &ndash; PbsC, a RiPP recognition element-containing partner protein &ndash; PbsD, an arginase &ndash; PbsE, a cupin-like hydroxylase &ndash; PbsQ, and a B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme &ndash; PbsB.</p>
<p>This biosynthetic sequence proceeds in a highly ordered fashion. PbsC and PbsD catalyze the regioselective ortho-hydroxylation of two phenylalanine residues within the FRF motif, yielding ortho-tyrosines. PbsE then converts the adjacent arginine into ornithine, but only when the substrate has been doubly hydroxylated &ndash; highlighting the strict substrate selectivity. PbsQ further hydroxylates the newly formed ornithine, and PbsB catalyzes a C–C cross-link between the aromatic rings of the ortho-tyrosines, forming a rigid biaryl macrocycle. The final maturation step, cleavage of the leader peptide, is carried out by a metalloprotease, PbsP.</p>
<p>Using tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR, the team confirmed the precise site and order of each transformation. Notably, the cross-linking reaction catalyzed by the B12-rSAM enzyme PbsB represents the first such example of C–C bond formation between aromatic residues by this enzyme class. The MNIO-mediated ortho-hydroxylation of phenylalanine residues is also unprecedented and marks a significant expansion of known MNIO function, which had previously been limited to Cys, Asn, and Asp residues.</p>
<p>The mature macrocyclic product closely mimics the structure of biphenomycin antibiotics, which were first isolated in the 1960s but whose biosynthetic origins remained undefined. Sequencing the genome of a known biphenomycin producer, <em>Streptomyces filipinensis</em>, revealed a highly homologous BGC, bpm cluster, strongly supporting a shared biosynthetic logic.</p>
<p>The researchers in the van der Donk team further employed AlphaFold3 to model protein–peptide interactions. The predicted structures revealed canonical β-sheet interactions between the precursor leader peptides and the RRE domain of PbsD and placed catalytically important residues in spatial proximity to active site metals, consistent with experimental data.</p>
<p>This work offers a compelling example of biosynthetic logic that combines strict substrate ordering with broad chemical novelty. It establishes a clear enzymatic route to biphenomycin-like compounds, offers a framework for analog production, and demonstrates the utility of combining genome mining, enzymology, and structural biology. Moreover, it deorphanizes an entire class of peptide antibiotics and introduces new enzymatic tools for peptide macrocyclization and posttranslational modification.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vanderdonk_jacs_june_2025_asap.jpg,,Biosynthesis of Biphenomycin-like Macrocyclic Peptides by Formation and Cross-Linking of <em>Ortho</em>-Tyrosines,"Chandrashekhar Padhi, Lingyang Zhu, Jeff Y.

<p>The team confirms that <em>S. constellatus</em> encodes a canonical comABCDE regulon—a QS circuit common in streptococci—which regulates the development of competence via CSP-mediated signaling. The mature CSP was identified as a 16-residue peptide, DSRIRMGFDFSKLFGK, through genomic analysis, chemical synthesis, and direct isolation from cell-free supernatants using RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry. Synthetic and isolated forms of the peptide were shown to be chemically identical and functionally potent in activating QS through the ComD histidine kinase receptor.</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess QS activity, the researchers in the Tal-Gan team developed a luciferase-based QS reporter strain and a ΔcomC mutant in which endogenous CSP production is eliminated. These tools enabled precise dissection of CSP analog activity without background interference. A full alanine scan and d-amino acid scan of the native CSP sequence revealed a highly nuanced structure–activity relationship. The alanine substitution I4A yielded a 60-fold increase in potency over the native signal –EC50 = 0.089 nM– whereas substitutions at conserved positions, D1, R3, L13, F14, abolished activity or converted the peptide into a competitive inhibitor. Importantly, these findings highlight key determinants of receptor recognition and activation unique to <em>S. constellatus</em>, differing notably from related streptococcal species.</p>
<p>Circular dichroism, CD, spectroscopy revealed that neither the native CSP nor its analogs adopted stable α-helical conformations in aqueous or membrane-mimicking environments, suggesting that secondary structure may be less critical for activity than specific side chain interactions. One exception, the R3A analog, exhibited β-sheet character and was biologically inactive – reinforcing the essential role of Arg3 in both structure and function.</p>
<p>Phenotypic assays confirmed that QS in <em>S. constellatus</em> robustly controls competence development, as measured by transformation efficiency with a spectinomycin resistance plasmid. Notably, wild-type strains were naturally competent without exogenous CSP, indicating constitutive endogenous signal production. In contrast, transformation was entirely abolished in the ΔcomC mutant, and could be rescued by exogenous CSP in a dose-dependent manner. The potent analog CSP I4A performed equivalently to native CSP, while CSP D1A effectively inhibited transformation, further validating its role as a competitive antagonist.</p>
<p>Contrary to observations in other streptococci, the <em>S. constellatus</em> QS system does not appear to regulate biofilm formation.

<p>This study demonstrates that a key determinant of this reactivity is the choice of solvent. By shifting from aqueous buffer to a mixed organic solvent system, MeOH/DCE, the authors observed a pronounced shift in the oxidation pathway, favoring productive Cα-oxidation over aryl ring oxidation. This change preserved side chains that were otherwise labile under aqueous conditions. Another important factor was the electronic nature of the aryl substituent. While the highly electron-rich dimethylaminophenyl group facilitated reactivity in water, it showed reduced efficiency in organic solvents. In contrast, the less electron-rich methoxyphenyl group delivered more reliable coupling in MeOH/DCE, with excellent retention of sensitive side chains.</p>
<p>Group members also refined the Pd-catalyzed <em>N</em>-arylation of amino acid methyl esters, expanding the accessible set of <em>N</em>-aryl building blocks. This expanded the method’s utility across a broader range of amino acids, including Lys, Orn, Asn, Gln, Asp, Ser, Trp, Tyr, and Glu.</p>

The molecule is...","<p>The <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex, BCC, is a group of Gram-negative bacteria with a dual identity—recognized both for their opportunistic infections in cystic fibrosis, CF, patients and for their remarkable biosynthetic capabilities in producing bioactive secondary metabolites. Among these metabolites is AFC-BC11, an unusual lipopeptide with potent antifungal activity against major phytopathogens. Despite previous recognition of its biological relevance, both the chemical structure and biosynthetic logic of AFC-BC11 have remained unresolved — until now.</p>
<p>In this study, researchers from the Süssmuth group at the Technische Universität Berlin, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, elucidated the structure of AFC-BC11 as an <em>N</em>-acyl tetrapeptide with a distinctive architecture. The molecule is composed of a myristoylated, <em>O</em>-methylated malic acid, MMFA, moiety at the <em>N</em>-terminus, followed by a highly unusual trimer of dehydro-β-alanine, DBA, residues, and capped at the <em>C</em>-terminus with a γ,δ-dehydro-lysine, DHLys. This precise structural arrangement is critical for the molecule’s antifungal activity and is highly sensitive to light, with photoisomerization rapidly diminishing its bioactivity.</p>
<p>The antifungal potency of AFC-BC11 is notable, displaying minimal inhibitory concentrations, MICs, in the sub-microgram range, 0.24–0.72 μg/mL, against plant pathogenic fungi such as <em>Colletotrichum kahawae</em> and <em>Pyrenophora teres</em> f. <em>teres</em>. Its performance exceeds that of commercial fungicides like azoxystrobin. Intriguingly, the compound demonstrates no inhibitory activity against common human fungal pathogens or bacteria, highlighting a selective mode of action that may reflect ecological specialization toward plant-associated fungi.</p>
<p>Beyond its potent bioactivity, the biosynthesis of AFC-BC11 is remarkable for its departure from classical nonribosomal peptide synthesis, NRPS. Unlike canonical NRPS systems, which depend on modular enzymes featuring condensation, C, domains for peptide bond formation, the biosynthetic gene cluster, afc BGC, for AFC-BC11 is conspicuously devoid of these features. Instead, the assembly proceeds via a thiotemplated mechanism centered around a single carrier protein, AfcK, which mediates the sequential transfer of intermediates through an intricate network of autonomous enzymes.</p>
<p>The assembly process begins with AfcQ, an adenylation domain that iteratively activates L-aspartate, which is subsequently decarboxylated to β-alanine by AfcP. This iterative process constructs the unusual DBA trimer that forms the molecular core. The growing peptide chain is then <em>N</em>-acylated by a fatty acyl-AMP ligase, AfcA, which specifically recognizes a mono-carboxylic acid. The precise selection of a trimeric β-alanine scaffold for acylation demonstrates a highly controlled biosynthetic checkpoint that prevents chain extension beyond three residues.</p>
<p>Subsequent steps involve the transfer of the peptidyl intermediate to AfcL, a ketoacyl synthase III, KAS III-like enzyme that facilitates the coupling of the peptide chain to a L-lysine-CoA conjugate, an unusual mechanism distinct from classical peptide release strategies. The lysine residue is further oxidatively tailored by AfcC, introducing a critical double bond into the <em>C</em>-terminal DHLys moiety. Parallel tailoring enzymes, including AfcS, AfcF, and AfcT, orchestrate the maturation of the MMFA moiety through citrate incorporation, oxidation, and methylation.</p>
<p>Despite the successful reconstitution of the peptide core assembly, certain aspects of the MMFA tail biosynthesis remain enigmatic, particularly the precise timing and enzymology of the citrate-derived modifications. Gene knockout studies underscore the essentiality of multiple tailoring enzymes and membrane-associated proteins in the final assembly and export of AFC-BC11.</p>
<p>The discovery of AFC-BC11’s biosynthetic mechanism offers not only a new antifungal scaffold for agricultural applications but also provides profound insights into noncanonical peptide assembly pathways in bacteria. The reliance on iterative adenylation, thiotemplated chain elongation, and KAS III-mediated peptide ligation represents a rare and elegant deviation from the NRPS paradigm. Moreover, the conservation of the afc gene cluster across diverse <em>Burkholderia</em> species hints at possible roles beyond antifungal activity, potentially contributing to bacterial virulence in CF patients or offering adaptive advantages in soil and plant-associated niches.</p>
<p>This work establishes AFC-BC11 as a member of a new class of peptidomimetic antifungals and opens avenues for bioengineering efforts to optimize its activity, stability, and spectrum. Its exquisite light sensitivity—while a hurdle for laboratory handling—raises intriguing questions about whether this property plays a functional role in the ecological interactions of <em>Burkholderia</em> with its environment.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sussmuth_jacs_jun_2025.jpg,,The Intricate Nonribosomal Assembly of a Potent Antifungal Lipopeptide from <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>,"Lei Zhong, Agnes Mühlenweg, Dou Hong, Sarah Yammine, Annette Poch, Dingchang Xu, Yasemin Kirimlioglu, Lisa Großgloß, Malo Boulanger, Franziska Graeger, Maria Seidel, Manuel Gemander, Grit Walther, Sebastian Kemper, Tam Dang, Monique Royer, Andi Mainz, Stéphane Cociancich, and Roderich D.

Traditional conjugation strategies rely on a one-to-one pairing of siRNA with a targeting ligand, such as <em>N</em>-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc, which facilitates hepatocyte-specific uptake. However, this monovalent approach limits the capacity to modulate pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficiency. In this collaborative study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em> by researchers from the Dahlén group at Astra-Zeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Andaloussi team at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, the authors present a versatile peptide-based scaffold for the multimerization of siRNA, offering a structurally precise, synthetically tractable platform to improve delivery, enhance silencing potency, and reduce off-target accumulation.</p>

	<p class=""small"" style=""margin-top: 11px;""><strong>Figure 1</strong>. General synthetic strategy for the siRNA multimers with the dimer-siRNA illustrated as an example. <strong>A|</strong> One-pot reaction undergoes both amide coupling between the ligand and the terminal lysine, and the SPAAC reactions between the ON and the azido-lysines core. <strong>B|</strong> After isolation of the intermediate using HPLC, the guide strands are annealed to generate the target dimer, <strong>C|</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Leveraging orthogonal bio-conjugation chemistries—including strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, the researchers developed branched peptide scaffolds capable of linking two to four siRNA units to a single GalNAc moiety. This design was further extended to include linear and cyclic architectures, dual-targeting configurations, and optional endosomal escape domains. The multimeric constructs maintained excellent duplex stability, Tm ~75–77°C, despite their increased complexity, and the synthesis proceeded efficiently in aqueous media without metal catalysts.</p>
<p>Cell-based assays in HEK293 cells and primary human hepatocytes, PHH, demonstrated that both dimeric and tetrameric siRNA scaffolds retained potent gene silencing activity, even though the number of siRNA units quadrupled relative to the monomer. Importantly, a single GalNAc ligand was sufficient to mediate robust cellular uptake for multivalent constructs. Mechanistic studies revealed that the orientation of the siRNA conjugation, whether 3' or 5', significantly influenced activity, particularly when guide strands lacked 5' phosphorylation. Constructs with 5'-linked passenger strands outperformed their 3'-linked counterparts unless pre-activated guide strands were used, highlighting a key design parameter for multimeric siRNA efficacy.</p>
<p>Further functional exploration demonstrated that the peptide scaffold could successfully accommodate dual-targeting constructs, exemplified by simultaneous knockdown of PPIB and SOD1. Cyclization of the peptide scaffold, while synthetically feasible and potentially advantageous for pharmacokinetics, did not markedly affect silencing potency <em>in vitro</em>. Similarly, the incorporation of endosomal escape domains, EEDs, did not yield additional activity, suggesting that the balance between targeting, internalization, and release remains highly context-dependent.</p>
<p>Biophysical characterization revealed that the hydrodynamic diameter increased predictably with multimer size, from 2.7 nm for the monomer to 6.8 nm for the tetramer, approaching the threshold for renal filtration exclusion. Correspondingly, plasma binding studies indicated a clear increase in protein association for the larger constructs, likely due to both phosphorothioate content and overall molecular geometry.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> pharmacokinetic studies in mice underscored the advantages of the multimeric design. Following intravenous administration, the tetramer displayed superior liver accumulation, improved silencing of the PPIB target gene, and a dramatic reduction in kidney exposure compared to the single-siRNA reference. Specifically, the tetramer achieved a tenfold improvement in the liver-to-kidney accumulation ratio, attributed to its size exceeding the glomerular filtration threshold. Notably, this improvement was achieved while using fourfold less GalNAc ligand per siRNA unit, offering a pathway to reduced ligand-associated toxicity.</p>
<p>In contrast, subcutaneous administration proved suboptimal for multimeric constructs, likely due to limited tissue diffusion and sequestration at the injection site, reinforcing the importance of administration route when deploying large, multivalent conjugates.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that peptide-based scaffolds are a powerful and flexible platform for siRNA multimerization, capable of improving biodistribution, extending duration of silencing, and reducing unwanted renal clearance, all without the need for nanoparticle encapsulation. These findings not only advance the toolkit for hepatic RNA delivery but also open possibilities for targeting alternative cell types, receptors, or tissues by adjusting ligand choice and scaffold architecture.</p>

<p>By grafting critical hot-spot residues from the natural MCL-1 binding partner NOXA-B onto the solvent-exposed surfaces of coiled-coil peptides, the researchers constructed a series of homo- and heterodimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, and monomeric scaffolds. These designs allow systematic exploration of how oligomerization, multivalency, and cooperativity influence PPI inhibition. Biophysical characterization, including AlphaFold2 modeling, fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, CD, spectroscopy, native mass spectrometry, MS, size-exclusion chromatography, SEC, and analytical ultracentrifugation, AUC, revealed that the homodimeric coiled-coil scaffold offers the optimal balance between stability, target engagement, and inhibitory potency.</p>
<p>Binding studies demonstrated that homodimeric coiled coils engage MCL-1 with mid-nanomolar inhibitory potency and exhibit positive cooperativity, forming 2:2 peptide:protein complexes that stabilize both partners. This cooperative behavior not only enhances target binding but also increases the thermal stability of the peptide scaffold itself, as evidenced by significant shifts in melting temperatures upon complex formation. The dimeric coiled coils are capable of recruiting two copies of MCL-1, a property not observed in monomeric or higher-order oligomeric designs.</p>
<p>In contrast, trimeric and tetrameric scaffolds displayed reduced potency, a result attributed to steric hindrance that limits the accessibility of grafted binding motifs. Structural modeling supports this observation, showing that excessive oligomerization leads to binding-site occlusion, preventing full engagement of MCL-1. Native MS and AUC corroborate that these higher-order scaffolds fail to maintain stable complexes with multiple MCL-1 molecules, and in some cases, oligomerization competes directly with target binding.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a monomeric control peptide—lacking a stable coiled-coil core but preserving the hot-spot motif—also achieved potent inhibition, highlighting the role of bind-and-fold mechanisms characteristic of MCL-1 interactions. However, this monomeric form does not benefit from the cooperative stabilization observed in the dimeric scaffold.</p>
<p>This study establishes the dimeric coiled-coil architecture as an exceptionally effective platform for designing inhibitors of α-helix-mediated PPIs. The capacity for cooperative binding and dual-target recruitment positions these scaffolds as promising candidates not only for direct PPI inhibition but also for the design of molecular glues capable of assembling ternary complexes for therapeutic applications, such as targeted protein degradation.</p>
<p>The findings further underscore a crucial design principle in peptide-based drug development: multivalency enhances potency only up to the point where structural crowding begins to outweigh the benefits of additional binding interfaces. As such, the dimeric coiled-coil emerges as a Goldilocks solution—sufficiently multivalent to engage targets cooperatively, yet simple enough to avoid self-occlusion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work advances the understanding of how self-assembled peptide scaffolds can be precisely engineered to modulate PPIs, providing a roadmap for the development of next-generation peptide therapeutics targeting difficult-to-drug intracellular proteins like MCL-1.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/woolfson_grafted_coils_1.jpg,"<p class=""small""><strong>Figure 2.</strong> AlphaFold2 modeling of coiled coils and their complexes with MCL-1: <strong>a|</strong> Each peptide sequence was modeled in AlphaFold2, AF2, varying the total number of peptide copies with the average pAE score for the best model - lower values in blue indicate a better model; <strong>b|</strong> Average pLDDT score for the best model - higher values in blue indicate a better model, data from the same prediction as <strong>a|</strong> ; <strong>c|</strong> The complex of the expected oligomeric state and varying numbers of bound MCL-1 protein/s was modeled with AF2 with the average pAE scores for the peptide residues shown - only the best model was used and lower values in blue indicate a better model; <strong>d|</strong> AF2 model for the CC-Di_E1 dimer bound to two copies of MCL-1; <strong>e|</strong> AF2 model for CC-Tri_E1 trimer bound to two copies of MCL-1 - steric clashes between MCL-1 protomers are evident; <strong>f|</strong> AF2 model for CC-Tet_E1 tetramer bound to two copies of MCL-1 - steric clashes between MCL-1 and adjacent peptides in the tetramer are evident; coiled-coil peptides are shown in orange, hot-spot residues as gray spheres and MCL-1 in dark green; the model is overlaid with the NOXA-B:MCL-1 structure, PDB ID 2JM6, first model, where NOXA-B is shown in cyan, hot-spot residues in gray spheres and MCL-1 in light green.</p>",Grafted Coiled-Coil Peptides as Multivalent Scaffolds for Protein Recognition,"Amanda M.

The lack of effective pharmacological interventions...","<p>Traumatic brain injury, TBI, remains a profound and unresolved clinical challenge, responsible for long-term disability in both civilian and military populations. The lack of effective pharmacological interventions stems, in part, from poor drug bioavailability in the injured brain. In particular, the blood–brain barrier, BBB, disruption following TBI creates a transient therapeutic window that remains underexploited. Among emerging strategies, the extracellular matrix, ECM, represents a compelling target, with upregulated components like tenascin-C serving as molecular beacons of injury. The short peptide CAQK, Cys-Ala-Gln-Lys, has previously demonstrated selective affinity for injury-induced ECM remodeling and holds promise as a targeting moiety for delivering therapeutics post-TBI. However, like most peptides, CAQK suffers from rapid systemic clearance and poor pharmacokinetics that limit its therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>In this study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em> by researchers from the <a href=""https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/ester-kwon"" target=""_blank"">Ester J. Kwon Lab</a> at Department of Bioengineering, University of California, La Jolla, systematically investigates whether PEGylation, a gold standard in extending peptide half-life—can effectively transform CAQK into a viable delivery vehicle for TBI applications. Moreover, the group members explore how linker chemistry, often treated as a technical afterthought, has profound implications on biodistribution, clearance, and targeting efficiency. Using an 8-arm, 40 kDa poly-ethylene-glycol, PEG, scaffold, the researchers synthesized CAQK–PEG conjugates via two orthogonal conjugation chemistries: maleimide–thiol Michael addition and strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, using DBCO–azide coupling. Both conjugates achieved equivalent peptide loading, ∼5 CAQK per PEG, and purity, ensuring a controlled comparison of linker-dependent pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that PEGylation extended the circulation half-life of CAQK by ~90-fold compared to the free peptide, effectively mitigating its rapid renal clearance. Upon systemic administration in a mouse model of controlled cortical impact, CCI, both CAQK-PEG conjugates demonstrated robust localization to the injured brain cortex. This accumulation was driven by both passive targeting through BBB disruption and active engagement with tenascin-C, as confirmed by colocalization in immunostained brain sections. Notably, the PEG-conjugated CAQK remained in the injured cortex for up to 24 hours, whereas free peptide was rapidly eliminated.</p>
<p>Despite comparable brain targeting, the two conjugation strategies diverged sharply in their off-target biodistribution. DBCO-linked conjugates exhibited significant retention in filtration organs, particularly the liver, kidneys, and spleen, driven by hydrophobic interactions and increased complement activation associated with the DBCO moiety. In contrast, maleimide-linked conjugates demonstrated faster clearance from non-brain tissues, likely owing to the more labile thiol-based linkage, resulting in a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile for CNS-targeted therapeutics.</p>
<p>The study further explored the concept of peptide-based prophylaxis, a particularly relevant strategy for military personnel at high risk of TBI. Remarkably, a single intravenous dose of maleimide-linked CAQK–PEG administered 24 hours prior to injury led to significant accumulation in the injured cortex, 4.5% injected dose per gram of tissue, a dramatic improvement over the free peptide, which was undetectable under the same conditions. This finding demonstrates that the prolonged circulation afforded by PEGylation, combined with injury-specific ECM targeting, can enable pre-emptive delivery to the brain—a paradigm-shifting approach for at-risk populations.</p>
<p>Taken together, this work underscores the critical role of conjugation chemistry in shaping the pharmacokinetic landscape of peptide–polymer therapeutics. While both PEGylation strategies successfully enabled brain targeting, the maleimide–thiol conjugates offered reduced off-target organ retention, enhancing their potential for clinical translation in TBI. The findings carry broader implications for the design of nanotherapeutics aimed at neuroinflammatory conditions, where balancing prolonged circulation with controlled clearance is paramount. Future work will need to consider alternative polymers to mitigate anti-PEG immunogenicity and refine linker stability to further optimize the therapeutic index of peptide-based nanomedicines.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kwon_bioconjugate_jun_25.jpg,,Impact of Conjugation Chemistry on the Pharmacokinetics of Peptide–Polymer Conjugates in a Model of Traumatic Brain Injury,"Jason Ren Wu, Akash Canjels, Rei Miyauchi, and Ester J.

A comprehensive...","<p><em>Streptococcus cristatus</em>, a commensal member of the oral microbiota and recently reclassified from <em>Streptococcus oligofermentans</em>, has emerged as a promising candidate in the pursuit of biotherapeutics targeting oral pathogens. A comprehensive study from the Tal-Gan Research Group at the University of Nevada at Reno, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology,</em> explores the quorum sensing, QS, mechanisms in <em>S. cristatus</em>, specifically the competence-stimulating peptide, CSP, and its downstream regulon, shedding light on how this innocuous organism could be leveraged to suppress <em>Streptococcus mutans</em>, the primary culprit behind dental caries.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional antibiotic approaches, <em>S. cristatus</em> exerts antimicrobial activity through endogenous mechanisms, particularly via hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, production. Previous work has shown that commensal streptococci like <em>S. gordonii</em> and <em>S. sanguinis</em> use QS-regulated pathways to produce inhibitory compounds, curbing the virulence of species like <em>S. mutans</em>. Given its low pathogenic potential and ability to generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in proximity to <em>S. mutans</em>, <em>S. cristatus</em> has garnered interest for its natural antagonistic properties.</p>
<p>At the heart of the study is the identification and functional validation of the native CSP used by <em>S. cristatus</em>. Genomic analysis and Sanger sequencing confirmed a 14-mer peptide, DLRNIFLKIKFKKK, which shares strong similarity with peptides from other Mitis group streptococci. The peptide was successfully isolated from culture supernatants using RP-HPLC and confirmed through MS/MS, aligning with previous detection in human saliva samples.</p>
<p>To quantify CSP activity, the authors developed a luciferase-based QS reporter strain responsive to the comX promoter. This system not only allowed detection of endogenous CSP production during early logarithmic growth but also measured activation profiles in response to synthetic analogs.</p>
<p>A suite of synthetic CSP analogs —including alanine scans, D-amino acid substitutions, and truncations— was synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis to parse out the functional contribution of each residue. Results from SAR analysis revealed that the <em>N</em>-terminal region, particularly Asp1 and Arg3, is critical for ComD receptor binding and activation, while the C-terminal lysine-rich tail was largely dispensable for bioactivity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, certain analogs exhibited inhibitory effects, such as CSP-D1A and CSP-desD1L2, which acted as competitive antagonists in the presence of native CSP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed that many active analogs adopted α-helical conformations in membrane-mimicking environments, TFE, though no strict correlation between helicity and activity was found.</p>
<p>RNA-seq analysis 10 minutes after CSP exposure showed a robust upregulation of canonical competence genes, including the comG operon, dprA, and comE. These genes are involved in DNA uptake and transformation, underscoring the activation of the competence regulon. Conversely, genes related to sugar metabolism and PTS transport systems were downregulated, reflecting a metabolic shift toward QS-related activity. However, genes specifically linked to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or bacteriocin production were not significantly upregulated at this time point, suggesting that timing and external stimuli may modulate their expression.</p>
<p>Phenotypic assays validated the transcriptomic findings. Exposure to native CSP enabled <em>S. cristatus</em> to uptake exogenous plasmid DNA containing spectinomycin resistance, demonstrating functional competence. The inhibitory analogs successfully blocked transformation when co-administered, supporting their utility in CSP pathway modulation.</p>
<p>Despite no observed effect on biofilm formation, hydrogen peroxide assays revealed that CSP exposure significantly increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, particularly at higher concentrations. This production was attenuated by CSP antagonists, affirming partial QS control over this phenotype.</p>
<p>The ultimate test of <em>S. cristatus's</em> biotherapeutic potential came in the form of agar plate assays, where it was co-cultured with <em>S. mutans</em>. Clear zones of inhibition appeared around <em>S. cristatus</em> colonies exposed to high CSP concentrations, especially when plated against an <em>S. mutans</em> strain lacking mutacin production, ΔcomC. These results confirm that <em>S. cristatus</em>, when primed via QS, can antagonize <em>S. mutans</em> through mechanisms likely involving peroxide formation.</p>

Focusing on naturally occurring and engineered peptides from plants, animals, and human proteins, the article details their structural features, cell-penetrating mechanisms, and capacity to deliver bioactive cargos to cytosolic targets.</p>
<p>Particular attention is given to cyclotides, especially the trypsin-inhibitor MCoTI-II and Möbius-type kalata B1, which exhibit remarkable proteolytic stability and selective internalization via endocytic or lipid-targeting pathways. The authors show how MCoTI-II can be modified to deliver peptide inhibitors that disrupt protein–protein interactions in cancer and stress-response pathways. Kalata B1, despite its more limited amenability to modification, displays superior uptake via specific interactions with phosphatidylethanolamine-rich membranes.</p>
<p>The review also explores β-hairpin peptides like <em>gomesin</em> and <em>tachyplesin I</em>, which combine strong membrane affinity with selective toxicity and can be cyclized to enhance cellular uptake and target delivery. The team presents examples where these scaffolds are engineered to disrupt cancer metabolism, kill intracellular bacteria, or inhibit challenging cytosolic targets such as <em>LDH5</em> and <em>p53–MDM2/MDMX</em> complexes.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors introduce <strong>PDIP</strong>—a synthetic, α-helical peptide inspired by human platelet factor 4—that selectively penetrates malaria-infected red blood cells and cancer cells. PDIP and its analogs are used to deliver both peptides and small-molecule drugs through cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, demonstrating modular design and broad therapeutic scope.</p>
<p>Finally, the article highlights recent advances in <strong><em>de novo</em> peptide design</strong>, showing that compact, internally hydrogen-bonded macrocycles can achieve cell permeability and even oral bioavailability. These findings underscore the growing convergence of nature-inspired scaffolds with AI-driven peptide engineering, paving the way for next-generation peptide therapeutics targeting previously ""undruggable"" intracellular pathways.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/craik_malins_biochemistry_april_2025.jpg,,Cell-Penetrating Cyclic and Disulfide-Rich Peptides Are Privileged Molecular Scaffolds for Intracellular Targeting,"Sónia Troeira Henriques, Nicole Lawrence, Meng-Wei Kan, Lara R.

</div>
<p>Self-assembling peptide hydrogels are central to biomaterials development, offering promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and immunomodulation. While racemic mixtures of L- and D-peptides have shown advantageous material properties — including enhanced stiffness, protease resistance, and thermal stability — the field has lacked atomic-level insights into the supramolecular interactions that govern these effects.</p>
<p>To overcome the crystallization challenges posed by flexible, fibrillar gel networks, the team developed a deliberate structure-guided approach: they truncated the parent MAX1 peptide, introduced cyclization via δ-linked ornithine, and incorporated Cα-methylation to guide and restrict hydrogen bonding. These modifications transformed the assembly behavior, yielding mirror-image macrocyclic peptides capable of forming crystals instead of gels.</p>
<p>High-resolution X-ray crystallography revealed that the racemic mixture of these cyclic peptides self-assembles into flat, fibril-like structures composed of alternating blocks of enantiopure β-hairpins. These domains form both canonical pleated β-sheets and — at the heterochiral interface — a parallel rippled β-sheet stabilized by interdigitated side chains and complementary van der Waals interactions. This ripple structure is framed by flanking Cα-methyl groups that define its registry and boundary — an elegant molecular bookend.</p>
<p>Importantly, these racemic fibrils were denser and more tightly packed than their homochiral counterparts, offering a plausible structural basis for the enhanced mechanical properties observed in racemic hydrogels. The findings not only validate long-standing theoretical predictions but also open a design pathway to engineer stereocomplexed hydrogels with atomic precision.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates that phase-state modulation through rational molecular design can serve as a powerful tool for revealing fundamental structural motifs. The identification of parallel rippled β-sheets provides a new scaffold for future biomaterials and invites the design of responsive, enantioselective peptide systems with built-in control over morphology, mechanics, and function.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/schneider_joel_jacs_april_2025.jpg,,From Hydrogel to Crystal: A Molecular Design Strategy that Chemically Modifies Racemic Gel-Forming Peptides to Furnish Crystalline Fibrils Stabilized by Parallel Rippled β-Sheets,"Tuan D.

A recent study from Nicholas Mitchell’s group at the University of Nottingham, in collaboration with Charlie Swan under a UKRI EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship, published in <em>Organic Letters</em>, introduces a modular, metal-free, and neurotoxin-free route to stereopure cyclopropane amino acid building blocks using common reagents and mild reaction conditions. The approach centers on a Hofmann rearrangement and cyclic carbamate intermediates, yielding versatile precursors suitable for solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS, and other synthetic applications.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />Cyclopropane motifs are widely utilized in medicinal chemistry, notably within antiviral drugs like Simeprevir and natural compounds such as coronatine. Their ring strain imparts conformational constraints that enhance receptor specificity and proteolytic resistance. However, existing routes to cyclopropane amino acids often require chiral catalysts, hazardous reagents, or laborious purification. This work seeks to streamline access to such building blocks by avoiding transition metals and neurotoxic oxidants, while maintaining high stereoselectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Strategy</strong><br />The authors build upon a known malonate-epichlorohydrin pathway, enabling the generation of a key intermediate—cyclopropanecarboxamide—via a concise, chromatography-free sequence. A Hofmann rearrangement with trichloroisocyanuric acid, TCCA, facilitates intramolecular trapping of an isocyanate to generate a stable, enantioenriched cyclic carbamate. This scaffold forms the cornerstone of a versatile toolkit, allowing for various protecting group installations and downstream derivatization.</p>
<p><strong>Key Advances</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scalability and Simplicity:</strong> The initial steps, involving ring-opening and amide formation, proceed cleanly on decagram scales without chromatography.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cyclic Carbamate Stability:</strong> The resulting intermediate is chemically robust but selectively reactive, allowing nucleophilic ring-opening to yield either halogenated or hydroxylated products.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Novel Ring-Opening Bromination:</strong> A standout innovation is the S<sub>N</sub>2 bromination of protected cyclic carbamates—providing access to electrophilic intermediates without requiring alcohol activation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversification via Nucleophiles:</strong> The resulting bromides undergo substitution to furnish analogues of natural residues like homocysteine and β-aminoalcohols, expanding chemical space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SPPS Compatibility:</strong> The authors demonstrate a one-pot deprotection and Fmoc protection, yielding SPPS-ready analogues. As proof of concept, a cyclopropane-homoserine derivative was successfully incorporated into an Osteostatin analogue using standard peptide synthesis protocols.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications and Outlook</strong><br />The synthetic strategy proves adaptable to a range of nucleophiles and oxidation pathways, producing amino acid variants relevant to drug development and peptide engineering. The cyclopropane motif’s conformational rigidity and ability to modulate biological properties make these building blocks particularly attractive for designing stable peptide therapeutics, including antimicrobial and hormone-mimicking agents.</p>
<p>By enabling high-fidelity, scalable synthesis of stereodefined cyclopropane amino acids from readily available starting materials, this work marks a significant step forward in expanding the noncanonical amino acid toolkit. The methodology is well-suited for modern peptide chemistry, allowing medicinal chemists to explore constrained peptide backbones without relying on rare metals or complex separations.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mitchell_org_let_april_25.jpg,,A Modular and Scalable Route to Protected Cyclopropane Amino Acid Building Blocks,"Charlie T.

Drawing on well-established sequence-to-structure rules in coiled-coil assemblies, the team used programmed heptad repeats—particularly residues at the <strong>a</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>e</strong>, and <strong>g</strong> positions—to favor specific oligomeric states and prevent homomeric aggregation.</p>
<p>A key outcome of this work, which is published as an ASAP article in <em>Biochemistry</em>, is the elucidation of how subtle sequence architecture, namely the register, starting position, of the heptad repeat, can direct the relative orientation of helices within a multichain assembly. Using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, dye-binding assays, and proximity-dependent fluorescence quenching, the authors showed that peptides with identical composition and stoichiometry could assemble into either parallel or antiparallel barrels depending solely on the register of the heptad repeat. Remarkably, “<strong>g</strong>”-register peptides assembled into parallel barrels, while “<strong>b</strong>” and “<strong>c</strong>” registers favored antiparallel arrangements.</p>
<p>High-resolution X-ray crystallography of the <strong>g</strong>-register assembly confirmed a parallel A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub> αHB structure, the first such structure reported for a mixed-charge six-helix coiled-coil barrel.

This underscores both the power and limitations of AI-based structure prediction for higher-order multimeric systems.</p>
<p>These findings add a new design parameter—heptad register—to the coiled-coil toolbox, complementing hydrophobic core packing and electrostatic pairing strategies. Moreover, the ability to specify helix orientation through register selection opens avenues for precision design of peptide-based nanostructures, particularly those requiring asymmetric topology, directional assembly, or channel formation.</p>

While strides have been made in creating water-soluble peptide assemblies, translating that precision to transmembrane systems is significantly more complex due to the dynamic, amphipathic environment of lipid bilayers.</p>
<p>In a groundbreaking international collaborative work led by Dr Ai Niitsu, RIKEN, Japan, Prof. Dek Woolfson, University of Bristol, UK, Prof. Mark Wallace at King’s College London, UK, and also including researchers from the University of Glasgow, the University of Oxford, and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, present a suite of rationally and computationally designed α-helical barrels, αHBs, — modular, membrane-inserting peptides that assemble into channels of defined stoichiometry and conductance. These dynamic constructs offer a powerful new toolkit for synthetic biology and bioengineering, enabling voltage-responsive, tunable ion flow through artificial membranes.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Engineering Functional α-Helical Barrels from Coiled-Coil Principles</h2>
<p>The design centered on coiled-coil packing motifs, leveraging the well-understood knobs-into-holes, KIH, interactions that underlie coiled-coil stability. Using a heptad repeat strategy, g–a–d–e, researchers screened 144 combinations to optimize helix–helix specificity. The lead design, termed CCTM-SaVbIcNd, was predicted to form a membrane-compatible, polar-lined barrel conducive to ion passage.</p>
<p>Peptides were synthesized and experimentally characterized in micellar and bilayer environments. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed pentameric assembly, while CD spectroscopy verified high helicity. Atomistic molecular dynamics, MD, simulations revealed a stable, hydrated central pore, supporting its role as a conductive channel.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Two Conductance States: Sequence-Dependent and Dynamic</h2>
<p>Electrical recordings in planar lipid bilayers revealed two distinct conductance states for CCTM-SaVbIcNd:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Low-Conductance, LC, States:</strong> These were stable and sequence-specific, correlating with peptide stoichiometry and lumenal geometry. The LC conductance values varied predictably across sequence variants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Conductance, HC, States:</strong> These were dynamic and voltage-dependent, marked by discrete stepwise increases in conductance. All peptide variants showed similar HC characteristics, suggesting a shared, stochastic mechanism involving peptide rearrangement or recruitment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Tuning Geometry Through Rational Substitution</h2>
<p>The modular CCTM design proved amenable to rational alterations. Targeted substitutions at the a and c positions in the heptad repeat — which directly impact helix–helix interface angles — successfully shifted stoichiometries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Heptameric barrels were achieved by replacing Ile with Ala (CCTM-SaVbAcNd) or Ser with Thr (CCTM-TaVbIcNd).</p></li>
<li><p>A hexameric variant (CCTM-SaVbIcNd-S20C-ace) was created via Ser → Cys substitution and alkylation with iodoacetamide, introducing steric bulk at a key interface.</p></li>
<li><p>These substitutions validated the design logic: smaller side chains permitted tighter packing, favoring heptamers, while bulkier groups expanded the barrel, yielding hexamers or pentamers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Single-Channel Optical Recordings Confirm Dynamic Behavior</h2>
<p>To determine whether HC states arose from single barrels or multiple channels, optical single-channel recordings, oSCR, were performed using droplet interface bilayers. The results were definitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HC steps originated from individual peptide barrels, not multiple insertions.</p></li>
<li><p>Channels displayed dynamic, reversible transitions between conductance states, consistent with changes in barrel radius or stoichiometry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further MD simulations of decameric and larger barrels under high membrane potentials supported this view, showing stable, elliptically shaped pores that collapsed in the absence of voltage — reinforcing the notion of voltage-gated structural plasticity.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Sequence–Stoichiometry–Function Relationships: Toward Predictive Design</h2> <p>While high-resolution structural data were not available, the study revealed strong correlations between sequence variants, oligomeric stoichiometry, and resulting conductance profiles:</p> <ul> <li><p>Tightly packed heptamers with Ala-rich interiors yielded the lowest conductance.</p></li> <li><p>Looser, polar-lined pentamers supported higher ion flow.</p></li> <li><p>Exterior-facing mutations — for example, Trp to Lys — had minimal effect, suggesting that lumenal residues primarily dictate channel behavior.</p></li> </ul> <p>These results support a rational design approach based on sequence-driven modulation of geometry and function — laying the groundwork for predictive engineering of synthetic ion channels, even in the absence of atomic-level structural data.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Conclusion: Toward Designer Membrane Channels with Precision Control</h2>
<p>This work demonstrates a rational path to constructing <em>de novo</em> membrane-spanning ion channels with programmable architecture and conductance. The duality of stable low-conductance states and dynamic, voltage-dependent expansion mirrors natural mechanisms seen in antimicrobial peptides like alamethicin — but with unprecedented control over sequence and structure.</p>
<p>These insights pave the way for next-generation applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Voltage-sensitive biosensors</p></li>
<li><p>Selective filtration systems</p></li>
<li><p>Synthetic cells with tunable permeability</p></li>
<li><p>Engineered microbes for bioproduction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The study underscores a critical principle in synthetic biology: with the right design rules, we can not only mimic biological functions — we can reimagine them.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wallace_woolfson_jacs_mar_2025.jpg,,Designing Dynamic Ion Channels from Scratch: Rational Strategies for Membrane-Spanning α-Helical Barrels,"Ai Niitsu, Andrew R.

In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the D'Amelio Lab at Université de Picardie Jules Verne, in Amiens, France, systematically evaluate CatBF’s antimicrobial action across clinical strains and explore its unique membrane-targeting mechanism using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

</div>	
<p>CatBF’s activity was tested against 81 clinical bacterial isolates, including highly resistant strains of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, many of which carried carbapenemases and other drug resistance mechanisms. Remarkably, CatBF exhibited submicromolar MIC values against a majority of these strains, with most isolates inhibited at concentrations between 0.5 and 1.1 μM. Its efficacy appeared unrelated to Gram classification or resistance genotype, suggesting a mechanism of action that bypasses traditional antibiotic targets entirely.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was borne out through structural and functional analysis. In aqueous solution, CatBF remains largely unstructured, but upon encountering model membranes—ranging from micelles and bicelles to uniaxially aligned bilayers—the peptide’s N-terminal region adopts a well-defined α-helical structure. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this helix orients itself nearly parallel to the membrane surface, with its positively charged side chains likely establishing salt bridges with phospholipid phosphate moieties and its hydrophobic face making contacts with the membrane core. The C-terminal segment, beginning with a proline residue, remains flexible and unstructured—a design that may aid in versatility without compromising function.</p>

Salt bridges between charged lysine/arginine residues, blue sticks, and lipid phosphate, yellow spheres, are shown as red dotted lines.</p>
</div>	
<p>At low concentrations, CatBF inserts shallowly into bacterial membranes, positioning itself just beneath the phosphate headgroups. This strategic placement, combined with its high positive charge, +11, enables CatBF to rapidly neutralize membrane surface charge and destabilize lipid packing. Solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that even a few peptide molecules can generate significant membrane curvature and perturbation—ultimately leading to the formation of toroidal pores. These transient, disordered channels allow for ion leakage and cell death, yet do not require the peptide to span the membrane fully or adopt a transmembrane orientation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CatBF shows a strong preference for negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol, PG, and cardiolipin, CL, which are enriched in bacterial membranes but rare in mammalian cells. This selective affinity helps explain both the peptide’s potent antibacterial activity and its minimal interaction with phosphatidylcholine-rich mammalian membranes, which remained structurally intact even in the presence of high peptide concentrations. Unlike many AMPs that must accumulate to high densities before exerting effects, CatBF disrupts bacterial membranes at very low molar ratios—a feature attributed to both its high charge and efficient surface recruitment of specific lipids.</p>
<p>As the peptide concentration increases, CatBF appears to self-associate on the membrane surface, producing cooperative effects that further destabilize lipid bilayers. At higher concentrations, changes in the peptide’s orientation and oligomeric state become apparent, suggesting a continuum of action that ranges from surface interaction and lipid demixing to pore formation and full-scale membrane collapse. Despite its potent activity, CatBF avoids nonspecific toxicity by sparing mammalian membrane models and limiting its depth of insertion.</p>
<p>Beyond its antibacterial action, CatBF’s structure and behavior suggest potential applications in antifungal and anticancer therapy as well. In simulations with phosphatidylserine-rich membranes—resembling those of fungi and apoptotic cancer cells—CatBF maintained a strong preference for interaction, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges while causing local membrane deformation. These interactions likely contribute to its observed effects in earlier studies targeting <em>Candida</em> species and tumor cells.
<p>Taken together, these findings position Cathelicidin-BF as an extraordinarily promising lead compound in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Its combination of broad-spectrum efficacy, resistance-agnostic mechanism, and selective membrane targeting offers a compelling template for rational AMP design. As global efforts intensify to develop novel antimicrobials, CatBF provides a blueprint—not only for how peptides can be engineered to overcome resistance—but for how nature’s molecules might hold the key to our most urgent clinical challenges.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/damelio_jacs_mar_24_2025_3.jpg,,Cathelicidin-BF: A Potent Antimicrobial Peptide Leveraging Charge and Phospholipid Recruitment against Multidrug-Resistant Clinical Bacterial Isolates,"Evgeniy Salnikov, Morgane Adélaïde, Francisco Ramos-Martín, Ahmad Saad, Jennifer Schauer, Martina Cremanns, Mariam Rima, Christopher Aisenbrey, Saoussen Oueslati, Thierry Naas, Niels Pfennigwerth, Söeren Gatermann, Catherine Sarazin, Burkhard Bechinger, and Nicola D’Amelio","<em>J.

<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Designing Autocatalytic Precision from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>Using the bacterial pilin protein RrgA as a structural template, researchers developed three synthetic proteins — dnIPB-1, dnIPB-2, and dnIPB-3 — sharing less than 31% sequence identity with the native RrgA C-terminal domain. Central to their design is a solvent-shielded catalytic triad (Lys–Asn–Glu) embedded within a hydrophobic core, mimicking the natural configuration necessary for IPB formation.</p>
<p>The proteins were constructed using a generative diffusion model, RFdiffusion, to create new backbones that supported the catalytic motif, followed by sequence optimization with ProteinMPNN and structure prediction with AlphaFold2. From an initial pool of over 20 designs, dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2 demonstrated high structural integrity and successful autocatalysis <em>in vitro</em>. Notably, insights from these designs informed a revision of the initially inactive dnIPB-3 variant, rescuing its catalytic potential.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Structural Confirmation and Stability</h2>
<p>Crystallographic analysis confirmed IPB formation in both dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2, revealing close alignment between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 predictions. Both proteins adopted β-sandwich architectures consistent with immunoglobulin-like folds, yet showed divergent topologies and sizes — indicating flexibility in scaffold design as long as the IPB motif remains intact and solvent-protected.</p>
<p>Thermal and chemical denaturation assays revealed high stability in the designed proteins, particularly dnIPB-2, which withstood temperatures &gt;100°C and denatured only at high concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. Mutation of the IPB-forming Asn residue, N148A, resulted in significant destabilization, directly linking covalent bond formation to enhanced structural robustness.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Probing Determinants of Autocatalysis</h2>
<p>An alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of dnIPB-2 identified several critical residues — especially those forming a hydrophobic lid above the catalytic site — essential for IPB formation. Surprisingly, mutations within a flexible β-strand-loop region tolerated substitutions without loss of function, provided that the lid architecture remained intact. These findings emphasize the necessity of a preorganized, solvent-shielded active site for catalytic activity.</p>
<p>In redesigning dnIPB-3, shortening an overextended loop improved core packing and restored autocatalytic ability, underscoring the utility of experimental validation even for high-confidence structural predictions.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Toward Novel Tag–Catcher Systems</h2>
<p>Inspired by the SpyTag/SpyCatcher platform, the team engineered tag–catcher systems by splitting the designed proteins at the IPB site. While the dnIPB-1 split failed to complement, the dnIPB-2 split successfully formed covalently linked complexes when paired with sfGFP-tagged segments. This result marks a promising proof-of-concept for customizable <em>de novo</em>-designed Tag–Catcher tools with potential applications in biotechnology and nanomaterials.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Expanding the Toolbox of Protein Engineering</h2>
<p>This work from the Tezcan lab demonstrates the successful <em>de novo</em> design of autocatalytic enzymes with precise structural and functional fidelity. Beyond validating a new approach for building catalytically active proteins, these designs explore sequence–structure–function relationships outside evolutionary constraints. The findings open new avenues for creating robust protein-based materials, therapeutics, and modular bioconjugation platforms.</p>

Researchers at Emory University, led by Monika Raj, have developed a novel chemical carbonylation strategy that selectively converts arginine residues into glutamate-5-semialdehyde, enabling precise modifications of peptides and proteins. Published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, this breakthrough provides the first non-enzymatic method for selectively inducing arginine oxidation, a modification previously limited to uncontrolled reactive oxygen species, ROS-driven, processes or metal-catalyzed oxidation, MCO.</p>
<p>Arginine carbonylation plays a key role in disease-associated oxidative stress, with implications in Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease. However, until now, no selective chemical approach existed for incorporating this PTM into proteins, limiting the ability to study its biological significance. Inspired by MCO mechanisms, the research team developed a metal-free strategy using 9,10-phenanthrenequinone derivatives, enabling direct conversion of arginine into glutamate-5-semialdehyde under mild conditions. This method provides a rapid, robust, and chemoselective approach to introducing this modification in proteins, facilitating chemoproteomic studies and offering a new tool for functional proteomics.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Key Advances in Chemical Carbonylation</h2>
<p>Arginine’s guanidinium group presents a formidable challenge for chemical modification due to its low nucleophilicity and resistance to oxidation. The authors addressed this by leveraging diketone electrophiles, specifically 9,10-phenanthrenequinone analogs, which enhance conjugation and electrophilic activation, allowing for controlled oxidation of arginine. Through extensive optimization, they established reaction conditions in which aqueous-phase oxidation successfully converted arginine residues in peptides and proteins to glutamate-5-semialdehyde under mild, biocompatible conditions.</p>

<p>The method demonstrated high selectivity for arginine, with no cross-reactivity observed with other amino acids, including lysine, cysteine, and methionine, which are typically susceptible to oxidation. The team optimized the reaction using small peptides, and subsequently extended the strategy to full-length proteins, including myoglobin, aprotinin, ubiquitin, and RNase, achieving conversion efficiencies ranging from 70–95%.</p>
<p>In a proteome-wide chemoproteomic analysis, the method was further validated in cell lysates, revealing previously unknown arginine oxidation hotspots. By selectively modifying arginine residues and profiling them through mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the authors identified protein motifs enriched in carbonylation sites, including sequences rich in glycine, proline, alanine, and glutamic acid. These findings suggest that certain protein microenvironments are inherently predisposed to oxidative modification, providing insight into oxidative stress regulation and protein aging mechanisms.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Applications in Chemical Biology and Proteomics</h2>
<p>Beyond its immediate implications for oxidative stress research, this chemical carbonylation approach serves as a versatile tool for protein modification, enabling:</p>
<p><strong>Selective PTM Installation:</strong><br>The aldehyde product of carbonylation serves as a chemical handle for further functionalization through reactions such as oxime formation and reductive amination. The authors demonstrated the site-specific incorporation of unnatural PTMs, including ornithine, methylated ornithine, and alkynylated ornithine, effectively expanding the scope of chemical protein editing.</p>
<p><strong>Fluorescent Labeling of Carbonylated Proteins:</strong><br>By leveraging aldehyde-specific fluorophores, the researchers successfully visualized carbonylated proteins in cell lysates and demonstrated selective in-gel fluorescence detection of oxidized proteins, providing a new method for live-cell imaging of oxidative modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Cellular Profiling of Oxidative Stress Targets:</strong><br>The study showed that chemically induced carbonylation could mimic oxidative stress conditions, offering a powerful platform for studying redox biology. The chemoproteomic analysis revealed that arginine residues in regulatory, enzymatic, and structural proteins are particularly susceptible to carbonylation, reinforcing the biological significance of this PTM.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Protein Carbonylation Research:</strong><br>The ability to chemically install arginine carbonylation within proteins overcomes a major limitation in oxidative stress research. Previously, carbonylation could only be studied through indirect detection of oxidative damage, limiting the ability to precisely interrogate its role in protein function. This work establishes a direct, tunable chemical approach, providing researchers with a powerful tool for exploring disease-related protein oxidation.</p>
<p>Importantly, the method also sheds light on the structural consequences of arginine oxidation. The study found that carbonylation-induced Schiff base formation with lysine residues, potentially leading to protein cross-linking and aggregation, which are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders and cellular aging. The ability to generate and study these modifications <em>in vitro</em> provides a critical step forward in understanding how oxidative stress drives disease pathology.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Conclusion and Future Perspectives</h2>
<p>This study represents a significant advance in chemical biology, offering the first selective, metal-free approach for arginine carbonylation. By successfully reproducing a biologically relevant PTM through chemical means, this work enables new research into protein oxidation, disease biomarkers, and redox-based cellular regulation.</p>

19796,Enlicitide Decanoate,3/28/25 14:03,David A.,Thaisrivongs,"Director, Process Research and Development",Merck,,Enlicitide Decanoate,"The total synthesis and process development of enlicitide decanoate, MK-0616, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, PCSK9, represents a major breakthrough in macrocyclic peptide...","<p>The total synthesis and process development of enlicitide decanoate, MK-0616, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, PCSK9, represents a major breakthrough in macrocyclic peptide synthesis. This innovative molecule is under development as a therapeutic for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ASCVD, addressing a critical need for effective and patient-friendly cholesterol management therapies. Unlike previous PCSK9 inhibitors, which are monoclonal antibodies requiring parenteral administration, enlicitide is an entirely synthetic small molecule that can be taken orally. This distinction necessitated the development of a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy capable of meeting anticipated global demand.</p>
<p>The structural complexity of enlicitide posed a significant challenge in synthetic chemistry. The molecule comprises eight amino acid residues, six of which are noncanonical, alongside two macrocyclic domains, including a 37-membered macrocycle incorporating an elaborated non-peptidic fragment. Additionally, an ammonium-containing side chain critical for biological activity further complicated synthesis, given its polarity and impact on solubility. These structural features ruled out standard solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS, demanding a fully modular and convergent approach that would allow for industrial-scale production.</p>
<p>The first-generation synthesis of enlicitide, though a valuable proof of concept, was ultimately deemed impractical for commercial manufacturing. Spanning 63 total steps with 28 in the longest linear sequence, the process relied heavily on chromatography for purification and suffered from significant yield inefficiencies. The overall yield was so low that producing even a single 100 kg batch would require processing over 170 metric tons of early-stage intermediates. The synthetic strategy employed ring-closing metathesis, RCM, to construct the macrocyclic core and reserved the amidation of the ammonium side chain for the final steps. Despite successfully assembling the target molecule, the first-generation synthesis could not support large-scale production due to its inefficiencies.</p>

</div>
<p class=""small"">Scheme 8. Second Generation End Game Synthesis of Enlicitide</p>
<p>Recognizing these limitations, researchers at Merck developed a second-generation synthesis, significantly improving process efficiency, cost, and scalability. A key innovation in this revised approach was the strategic restructuring of the synthetic sequence to delay macrocyclization, thereby enhancing yield and minimizing chromatographic purification. The discovery of three crystalline intermediates enabled purification through crystallization rather than chromatography, streamlining the overall process. By refining the assembly of the Northern and Southern fragments, the Merck team achieved a dramatic reduction in step count—bringing the total down to 43 steps, with the longest linear sequence reduced to 21. Yield improvements were equally remarkable, increasing by a factor of 1000 compared to the first-generation synthesis. The process also incorporated a biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategy that simplified the synthesis of key noncanonical amino acids, enhancing both throughput and stereochemical control.</p>
<p>Published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, this work underscores the clinical relevance of enlicitide decanoate. PCSK9 inhibitors have emerged as a transformative class of lipid-lowering therapies, reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, by enhancing LDL receptor recycling. Until now, approved PCSK9 inhibitors, such as evolocumab and alirocumab, have been limited to injectable formulations, presenting barriers to widespread adoption. Enlicitide decanoate, as the first oral PCSK9 inhibitor, represents a paradigm shift in the field. Its high oral bioavailability, coupled with a convenient daily dosing regimen, addresses the major limitations of current therapies. The molecule has already demonstrated significant LDL-C reduction and excellent tolerability in Phase 2 clinical trials, positioning it as a highly promising candidate for global cholesterol management.</p>
<p>Beyond its immediate therapeutic implications, the successful synthesis of enlicitide marks a major advancement in macrocyclic peptide drug development. Historically, large-scale production of peptides has relied on fermentation or recombinant expression, with chemical synthesis largely reserved for smaller, less complex molecules. The development of a fully synthetic, industrially scalable route to enlicitide establishes a precedent for future macrocyclic peptide drugs, expanding the possibilities for chemically manufactured peptide therapeutics. The lessons learned from this endeavor—particularly in designing modular synthetic strategies, leveraging crystallization-driven purification, and optimizing macrocyclization sequences—will undoubtedly inform the development of next-generation bioactive peptides.</p>
<p>The Merck team concludes by emphasizing the broader impact of their work, not only in accelerating enlicitide’s clinical progress but also in setting a new benchmark for macrocyclic drug synthesis. By successfully bridging the gap between synthetic peptide chemistry and large-scale manufacturability, they have laid the foundation for a future in which complex bioactive peptides can be efficiently produced at commercial volumes. This work represents a compelling demonstration of how cutting-edge synthetic chemistry can drive innovation in pharmaceutical development, ultimately improving access to life-saving therapeutics worldwide.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/merck_jacs_03_24_25.jpg,Scheme 1.

Among the enzymatic systems...","<p>Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, RiPPs, represent an expanding class of natural products distinguished by their extensive post-translational modifications. Among the enzymatic systems that introduce structural complexity in RiPPs, radical S-adenosylmethionine, rSAM, enzymes catalyze unique cross-linking reactions. In a study from the Chin-Soon Phan Lab at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis in Riga, Latvia, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, researchers present the bioinformatic expansion of rSAM enzymes based on previously characterized families –StrB, NxxcB, WgkB, RrrB, TqqB, and GggB. Through functional expression in <em>Escherichia coli</em>, the newly identified enzyme WprB from <em>Xenorhabdus sp.</em> psl was found to catalyze a novel cross-link formation between tryptophan, Trp-C5, and arginine, Arg-Cγ, in three WPR motifs of the precursor peptide WprA.</p>
<p>rSAM enzymes are known to facilitate complex chemical transformations, including C-C, C-O, and C-N bond formations, thereby generating macrocyclic RiPP scaffolds. Previous studies have implicated enzymes such as DarE and DynA in the biosynthesis of darobactin and dynobactin, respectively, which have been recognized for their potential as novel antibiotics targeting Gram-negative bacteria. The Phan Lab study seeks to expand upon known rSAM enzymatic families through computational analysis and empirical validation.</p>
<p>A comprehensive sequence similarity network, SSN, analysis of rSAM enzymes identified cluster C11, which harbored previously uncharacterized members related to the WprB enzyme family. Using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online, RODEO, 28 putative precursor peptides were identified within this cluster, falling into two precursor families characterized by three WPR motifs and a single WxR/K motif. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that WprB shares 28.1% amino acid identity with WgkB, and that their genetic architectures exhibit notable similarities.</p>
<p>To validate the functional role of WprB, the precursor peptide WprA was expressed in <em>E. coli</em> alone, as well as in coexpression with WprB or WprB + WprC. Following purification via Ni-affinity chromatography and trypsin digestion, tandem mass spectrometry, MS/MS, analysis revealed the presence of peptide fragments displaying a consistent –2 Da loss, suggesting site-specific modifications at the WPR motifs.</p>
<p>To determine the precise cross-linking sites, 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, spectroscopy, HSQC, HMBC, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY, was employed. These analyses confirmed that WprB catalyzes a cross-link between Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ in WprA. The spatial correlation observed in NOESY spectra further substantiated the stereochemical arrangement of this novel bond formation.</p>
<p>While WprC was initially annotated as a hypothetical protein, sequence analysis suggested its role as a chaperone protein associated with WprB. Functional assays involving site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues R12 and R23 in WprC demonstrated a significant reduction in cross-link formation upon mutation, indicating its essential role in facilitating WprB activity.</p>
<p>To assess substrate-based catalysis, precursor peptide variants WprA R3G, R21G, and R39G were designed. Coexpression with WprBC, followed by LC-MS analysis, confirmed that WprB independently installs cross-links at all three WPR motifs. Unlike previously studied rSAM enzymes, such as DarE and XncB, which exhibit promiscuous catalysis, WprB displayed strict selectivity for Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ cross-links.</p>
<p>This study establishes WprB as a novel rSAM enzyme catalyzing a previously unreported Trp-C5 to Arg-Cγ cross-link topology. The discovery expands our understanding of RiPP enzymology and introduces potential applications in peptide engineering. Further investigations will focus on the mechanistic aspects of WprB-catalyzed transformations and its potential role in antibiotic development.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phan_chin-soon_jacs_feb_2025.jpg,,Radical SAM Enzyme WprB Catalyzes Uniform Cross-Link Topology between Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ on the Precursor Peptide,"Abujunaid Habib Khan, Jabal Rahmat Haedar, Vic Kiselov, Viktors Romanuks, Gints Smits, Stefano Donadio, Chin-Soon Phan","<em>J.

<p><strong>Addressing Key Challenges in Peptide Synthesis</strong><br>
SPPS enables the production of peptides and proteins with noncanonical amino acids and post-translational modifications, but synthesis efficiency is frequently hindered by peptide aggregation and poor solubility. The Hartrampf and Wang teams addressed these issues by incorporating SynTag into flow-based SPPS, demonstrating its ability to improve synthesis outcomes, reduce aggregation, and enhance solubility across multiple challenging peptide sequences.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aggregation Suppression: SynTag shifts the peptide conformation from β-sheet to α-helix, reducing inter- and intrachain interactions that contribute to aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced Solubility: The polyarginine tag increases hydrophilicity, facilitating HPLC purification and enabling direct hydrolysis to yield native peptide sequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Versatile Applications: SynTag was successfully employed in the synthesis of difficult peptides such as Barstar[75–90], amyloid-β Aβ[27–42], and the MYC transactivation domain, MYC[1–143].</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>Expanding the Chemical Toolbox</strong><br>
The study marks the first successful combination of automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, AFPS, with native chemical ligation, NCL, enabling the production of full-length MYC[1–143] via a single ligation step. Structural investigations using infrared spectroscopy, IR, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, SSNMR, confirmed that SynTag prevents aggregation by disrupting β-sheet formation, improving peptide synthesis efficiency.</p>
<p>By providing a single, cleavable tag that addresses both aggregation and solubility, SynTag represents a transformative advance in peptide chemistry.

Published in <em>JACS</em>, researchers in the James Nowick lab at the University of California at Irvine, present a novel approach to restoring and enhancing vancomycin's antimicrobial activity through conjugation with a teixobactin-based minimal pharmacophore. This strategy leverages dual-targeting of lipid II to counteract resistance mechanisms that undermine vancomycin's binding affinity.</p>

<p><strong>Background and Rationale</strong><br>
Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis by binding to the <em>d-Ala-d-Ala</em> moiety of lipid II, a critical precursor in peptidoglycan synthesis. Resistance emerges when bacteria replace <em>d-Ala-d-Ala</em> with <em>d-Ala-d-Lac</em>, diminishing vancomycin's affinity by three orders of magnitude. In contrast, teixobactin, an 11-residue macrocyclic depsipeptide, targets the pyrophosphate region of lipid II and its precursors, offering a resistance-agnostic mechanism. Prior research has demonstrated that modifications of vancomycin—such as amidine substitutions or guanidinium-terminal modifications—can partially restore activity against resistant strains, yet none have fully addressed vancomycin's inefficacy against VRE.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; margin: 13px 0 29px 0;"">

</div>
<p class=""small"">Abstract Image</p>
<p>Given teixobactin's binding specificity and the inability of Gram-positive bacteria to develop resistance through genetic mutation of the pyrophosphate target, this study hypothesized that covalent conjugation of vancomycin to a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore could yield synergistic antibacterial effects.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Design and Key Findings</strong><br>
For this study, Maria Sophia Teresa Lee Padilla and James S. Nowick, synthesized vancomycin–teixobactin conjugates via EDC coupling, focusing on Lys10-teixobactin and truncated teixobactin analogues. The conjugation occurred selectively at the lysine side-chain amine of Lys10-teixobactin, preserving key functional moieties of both antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, assays revealed that select conjugates exhibited substantial potency enhancements over their individual components and physical mixtures thereof.</p>
<p>Notable findings include</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Activity Against MRSA and MSSA</strong>: Conjugates such as benzoyl-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco exhibited MIC values of 0.5 μg/mL against MSSA, a twofold improvement over vancomycin, 1 μg/mL. The biphenyl analogue Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco demonstrated an MIC of 0.125 μg/mL against MSSA and 0.5 μg/mL against MRSA, representing a four- to eightfold enhancement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restored Efficacy Against VRE</strong>: While vancomycin alone was inactive against VRE, the Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco conjugate exhibited MIC values of 2–4 μg/mL. This underscores the ability of the teixobactin component to mitigate vancomycin's loss of affinity for <em>d-Ala-d-Lac</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bactericidal Mechanism</strong>: A time-kill assay against MRSA demonstrated that Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco reduced bacterial viability by three log10 units within four hours, in contrast to vancomycin, which permitted bacterial proliferation under equivalent conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Mammalian Cytotoxicity</strong>: Cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays confirmed that the conjugates maintain selectivity for bacterial targets, with only minimal hemolytic and cytotoxic activity at high concentrations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Implications and Future Directions</strong><br>
This study presents a compelling proof-of-concept for the use of vancomycin–teixobactin conjugates as next-generation antimicrobials. The dual-targeting mechanism represents a paradigm shift in combating resistant pathogens by addressing multiple vulnerability points within the bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis pathway.</p>
<p>Future optimizations could refine the linker chemistry to improve the flexibility and positioning of the two pharmacophores, thereby enhancing cooperative binding interactions with lipid II. Additionally, further structural modifications may yield conjugates with MIC values ≤1 μg/mL against VRE, meeting the threshold for highly potent clinical candidates. <em>In vivo</em> pharmacokinetic and toxicity assessments will be essential to validate the translational potential of these conjugates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that conjugation of vancomycin with a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore is an effective strategy for overcoming resistance in Gram-positive pathogens. This work lays the groundwork for the rational design of multi-targeting antimicrobial conjugates that could significantly alter the landscape of antibiotic resistance management.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nowick_sophie.jpg,,Vancomycin–Teixobactin Conjugates,Maria Sophia Teresa Lee Padilla and James S.

This method leverages the flavin-dependent halogenase MppI, which regioselectively brominates the indole-5 position of a tryptophan side chain within a macrocyclic peptide scaffold.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; margin: 19px 0 19px 0;""><img src=""https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/agarwal_vandedonk_org_lett_jan_25.jpg"" alt=""Abstract Image"" width=""573px;""></div>
<p>Brominated intermediates have long been favored in organic synthesis for their chemical versatility, particularly in transition-metal-assisted bond-forming reactions. The Agarwal and van der Donk study represents a significant leap in peptide modification, demonstrating the utility of MppI in facilitating regioselective bromination and subsequent Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, SMCC, reactions, a process that enables the attachment of diverse chemical moieties to peptide backbones.</p>
<p>Using a genome mining strategy, the team identified a biosynthetic gene cluster, BGC, from the marine cyanobacterium <em>Moorena producens</em>. This BGC encodes MppI, a halogenase, and MppM, a lanthionine synthetase responsible for thioether-mediated macrocyclization. Their findings reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regioselectivity:</strong> MppI brominates the indole-5 position of Trp80 within the macrocyclic peptide core, avoiding competing chlorination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Macrocyclization Preference:</strong> MppI exhibits higher bromination efficiency with macrocyclic substrates over linear precursors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leader Peptide Dependency:</strong> Bromination activity requires the presence of an intact N-terminal leader peptide, which mediates enzyme-substrate interactions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The macrocyclized and brominated peptide was subjected to SMCC with 4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid under mild conditions. The reaction demonstrated high specificity, forming a C–C bond at the brominated indole site. This method provides a versatile platform for introducing chemically reactive groups into macrocyclic peptides, expanding their potential for pharmacological applications.</p>
<p>Mechanistic insights into MppI revealed that a conserved lysine residue in its active site is essential for bromination.

<p>This research highlights the power of transformation-guided genome mining to uncover novel enzymatic functionalities, particularly for regioselective modification of challenging amino acid residues like tryptophan.

The ability to precisely manipulate the peptide backbone remains one of the fundamental challenges in biomolecular engineering. While ribosomal translation and peptide synthesis methods allow for modifications at the side chains, direct incorporation of carbon–carbon, C–C, bonds within the backbone has been an elusive goal. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from  the <a href=""https://gem-net.net/"" target=""_blank"">NSF Center for Genetically Encoded Materials</a>, NSF CGEM, led by postdoctoral fellow Carly Schissel, present a novel approach to peptide backbone editing by leveraging a spontaneous acyl rearrangement mechanism, enabling the first nonenzymatic formation of C–C bonds within ribosomal and synthetically derived peptides. By harnessing the reactivity of dehydrolactic acid, DHL, the researchers demonstrate a cascade of acyl shifts that result in backbone-embedded, polyketide-like, α,γ-diketoamide motifs, which can be further diversified into heterocyclic structures.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Challenges in C–C Bond Formation in Ribosomal Products</h2>
<p>Ribosomes are highly optimized molecular machines that catalyze the formation of amide bonds between α-amino acids. However, their synthetic scope has largely remained restricted to C–N, C–O, and C–S bond formations. Despite efforts to expand the ribosomal substrate range, the controlled introduction of backbone ketones—highly reactive motifs that enable late-stage functionalization—has remained challenging. Existing approaches to peptide backbone modification typically rely on side chain functionalization or post-synthetic chemical transformations. While direct, ribosome-mediated C–C bond formation within the peptide backbone remains elusive, our strategy leverages a post-translational transformation to achieve site-selective backbone modification, offering a programmable route to incorporate these key structural motifs.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">A Novel Acyl Shift Cascade Enables Backbone C–C Bond Formation</h2>
<p>This work introduces a strategy in which DHL-containing peptides undergo spontaneous isomerization to form α,γ-diketoamides, establishing a new C–C bond within the backbone. To enable this transformation, the α-hydroxy-phenylselenocysteine residue &ndash;an α-hydroxy acid derivative&ndash; can be introduced either ribosomally or via solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS. Oxidation generates DHL, and physiological conditions trigger an O to C acyl shift that results in diketone formation. The researchers demonstrate that these diketones are highly reactive and can be further derivatized using hydrazines and hydroxylamines to generate pyrazoles and oximes.</p>

The key C–C bond formation step is driven by the unique electronic properties of the DHL enolate intermediate, which undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. This reaction is conceptually similar to the Claisen condensation but takes place under physiological conditions without enzymatic assistance. The study also highlights the influence of pH on reaction efficiency, with optimal diketone formation occurring at neutral to slightly basic conditions.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Versatility and Synthetic Applications</h2>
<p>The authors demonstrate the broad applicability of this method by incorporating DHL into various peptide sequences. Tripeptide and longer peptide backbones modified with DHL readily undergo diketone formation and subsequent derivatization, indicating that this transformation is compatible with diverse amino acid contexts. The study further extends this approach to ribosomally synthesized peptides, showing that DHL can be genetically encoded and subsequently converted into diketone-bearing peptides via post-translational modification.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Implications for Peptide Engineering and Drug Development</h2>
<p>The approach presented by the researchers in the Schepartz lab, represents a significant step forward in peptide engineering, providing a new tool for embedding noncanonical motifs directly within the backbone. The ability to site-selectively introduce ketone groups expands the chemical space accessible to genetically encoded peptides, bridging the gap between peptide and polyketide scaffolds. Such modifications are expected to enhance peptide stability, membrane permeability, and bioactivity—key factors in drug development.</p>
<p>By offering a genetically programmable route to backbone C–C bonds, this work lays the foundation for new classes of bioactive peptides with unprecedented structural and functional diversity.

<p>The study highlights two pivotal applications of these functional assemblies. First, using Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, as a readout, the researchers demonstrate that specific αHBs can encapsulate two organic dyes—1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, DPH, and Nile red—within their channels, enabling highly efficient energy transfer on the picosecond timescale. Second, the αHBs facilitate the photodimerization of anthracene molecules, showcasing their ability to organize reactants within confined environments to promote specific chemical transformations. Importantly, the outcomes of these experiments depended on the precise selection and design of αHB structures, as not all configurations were equally productive, underscoring the importance of structural tuning.</p>

<p>The authors emphasize that these αHB peptide assemblies replicate key enzyme-like functionalities, including selective ligand binding and the promotion of reactive conformations, through the interplay of shape complementarity and hydrophobic interactions within their lumens—features typically achieved through complex active sites in natural enzymes. Moreover, the versatility of these αHBs extends far beyond the presented applications. Their thermostability, tolerance for mutations &ndash;including polar, charged, and noncanonical amino acids), and adaptability via computational protein design and directed evolution position them as promising tools for catalysis in aqueous environments.</p>

<p>In collaboration the Department of Physics and Department of Chemical Engineering, members of the Ronald Raines' group at MIT, published in <em>Biochemistry</em>, have developed a continuous Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, assay for esterase activity based on a peptidic substrate and a protease, Glu-C, that cleaves a glutamyl peptide bond only if the glutamyl side chain is a free acid.</p>

<p>Using pig liver esterase, PLE, and human carboxylesterases, we validated the assay with substrates containing simple esters, for example, ethyl, and esters designed to be released by self-immolation upon quinone methide elimination. The researchers found that simple esters were not cleaved by esterases, likely for steric reasons. To account for the relatively low rate of quinone methide elimination, they then extended the mathematics of the traditional Michaelis–Menten model to conclude with a first-order intermediate decay step.</p>
<p>By exploring two regimes of our substrate → intermediate → product, SIP, model, we evaluated the rate constants for the PLE-catalyzed cleavage of an ester on a glutamyl side chain (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> = 1.63 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>), and subsequent spontaneous quinone methide elimination to regenerate the unmodified peptide (k<sub>I</sub> = 0.00325 s<sup>–1</sup>; <em>t</em><sub>1/2</sub> = 3.55 min).

Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules.</p>
<p>To devise a platform technology for <em>de novo</em> discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, members from the Hiroaki Suga and Yuki Goto groups at the University of Tokyo, published in <em>Angewandte Chemie</em>, have integrated the thioether-macrocyclic peptide, teMP, library construction/selection technology, so-called RaPID, Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery, system, with a Trp-<em>C3</em>-prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp-containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure.</p>

Often, the binding sites of PPIs are shallow and feature large polar surfaces, which makes them difficult to inhibit using small molecules. Due to their size and polarity, peptide macrocycles have emerged as prominent scaffolds to inhibit PPIs and shallow allosteric binding sites on protein surfaces. Additionally, some macrocycles are capable of acting as ""molecular glues,"" which can fuse multiple proteins together at the site of PPIs.

<p>Longer helices lead to higher conductivity, and random coil peptides show substantially lower conductivity. The macrodipole of the helix increases with peptide length, leading to larger dielectric constants.

Macrocyclic peptides and peptidomimetic compounds are one class of molecules that have shown promise in engaging these difficult targets. Macrocyclization limits the conformational flexibility of a molecule, often resulting in higher affinity binding to proteins and RNA targets of interest. In the case of peptide ligands, macrocyclization provides opportunities for the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that can have profound effects on cell permeability and bioavailability. Therefore, the development of new methods for the efficient creation of macrocycles from linear precursors is an important goal. This is particularly true for the synthesis of libraries of macrocycles using diversity-oriented synthesis or split and pool strategies.</p>
<p>A study from the Kodadek Lab at the Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology, published in <em>Jacs Au</em>, introduces a novel solid-phase macrocyclization method generating 2-pyridone rings. The method relies on the intramolecular condensation between secondary and tertiary dimethoxy-propionic amide units, a selective reaction which leads to the formation of a single well-defined regioisomer. This method demonstrates remarkable efficiency in producing diverse peptidic and nonpeptidic bioactive targets, paving the way for the development of innovative macrocycle libraries featuring the 2-pyridone unit.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional peptide macrocyclization methods, the 2-pyridone linkage offers significant advantages. It requires fewer steps, achieving a high efficiency under mild conditions, making it simpler to implement. Unlike amide bond formation, which can suffer from intermolecular dimerization and necessitates high dilution, the 2-pyridone method is particularly suitable for smaller macrocycles like tetrapeptides. DMPA condensation exhibits a high selectivity, leading to high yields with minimal intermolecular side products. These findings collectively highlight the robustness and efficiency of the 2-pyridone linkage for peptide macrocyclization.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kodadek_jacs_aug_24.jpg,,Solid-Phase Synthesis of Diverse Macrocycles by Regiospecific 2-Pyridone Formation: Scope and Applications,Skander A.

The carrier is required to elicit T cell help via presentation of peptide epitopes on major histocompatibility complex, MHC, class II molecules; as such, attachment to full-sized proteins, alone or in a complex, is generally used to account for the significant MHC diversity in humans.</p>
<p>While such carrier-based vaccines have proven extremely successful, particularly in protecting against bacterial diseases, they can be challenging to manufacture, and repeated use can be compromised by pre-existing immunity against the carrier. One approach to reducing these complications is to recruit help from type I natural killer T, NKT, cells, which exhibit limited diversity in their antigen receptors and respond to glycolipid antigens presented by the highly conserved presenting molecule CD1d. Synthetic vaccines for universal use can, therefore, be prepared by conjugating haptens to an NKT cell agonist such as α-galactosylceramide, αGalCer, KRN7000. An additional advantage is that the quality of NKT cell help is sufficient to overcome the need for an extra immune adjuvant. However, while initial studies with αGalCer-hapten conjugate vaccines report strong and rapid antihapten antibody responses, they can fail to generate lasting memory.</p>

Despite similar protein backbones observed within the receptors and the N- and C-termini of the two peptides bound to the AMY<sub>1</sub>R complexes, they have distinct organization in the peptide midregions - the bypass motif - that is correlated with differences in the dynamics of the respective receptor extracellular domains.

Within model compounds and disordered peptides, the diastereotopic fluorines of Dfp exhibit similar chemical shifts, Δδ<sub>FF</sub> = 0–3 ppm, when a <em>trans</em> X–Dfp amide bond is present. In contrast, the diastereotopic fluorines exhibit a large, Δδ<sub>FF</sub> = 5–12 ppm, difference in chemical shift in a <em>cis</em> X–Dfp prolyl amide bond.</p>

<p>DFT calculations, X-ray crystallography, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy indicated that Δδ<sub>FF</sub> directly reports on the relative preference of one proline ring pucker over the other: a fluorine which is pseudo-axial, in essence,  the pro-4<em>R</em>-F in an <em>exo</em> ring pucker, or the pro-4<em>S</em>-F in an <em>endo</em> ring pucker, is downfield, while a fluorine which is pseudo-equatorial, in essence, pro-4<em>S</em>-F when <em>exo</em>, or pro-4<em>R</em>-F when <em>endo</em>, is upfield.</p>
<p>Thus, when a proline is disordered, a mixture of <em>exo</em> and <em>endo</em> ring puckers, as at <em>trans</em>-Pro in peptides in water, it exhibits a small Δδ. In contrast, when the Pro is ordered, such as, when one ring pucker is strongly preferred, as in <em>cis</em>-Pro amide bonds, where the <em>endo</em> ring pucker is strongly favored, a large Δδ is observed. Dfp can be used to identify inherent induced order in peptides and to quantify proline cis–trans isomerism.</p>

<p>Using Dfp, researchers in the <a href=""https://www1.udel.edu/chem/zondlo/"" target=""_blank"">Zondlo Lab</a> at the University of Delaware, published in <em>Biochemistry</em>, discovered that the stable polyproline II helix, PPII, formed in the denatured state, 8 M urea, exhibits essentially equal populations of the <em>exo</em> and <em>endo</em> proline ring puckers. In addition, the data with Dfp suggested the specific stabilization of PPII by water over other polar solvents.</p>
<p>These data strongly support the importance of carbonyl solvation and n → π* interactions for the stabilization of PPII. Dfp was also employed to quantify proline <em>cis–trans</em> isomerism as a function of phosphorylation and the R406W mutation in peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered protein tau. Dfp is minimally sterically disruptive and can be incorporated in expressed proteins, suggesting its broad application in understanding proline <em>cis–trans</em> isomerization, protein folding, and local order in intrinsically disordered proteins.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zondlo_figure_1.jpg,<strong>a</strong> Synthesis of Fmoc-Dfp–OH (<strong>3</strong>) from commercially available Boc-Dfp–OH (<strong>1</strong>). <strong>b</strong> Crystal structure (100 K data collection) of Fmoc-Dfp–OH·CHCl<sub>3</sub>.

To target this interaction, group members  synthesized a series of peptides, typified by Ac-A-(Sar)<sub>3</sub>-IIGMMLISAGVLI-KKK-NH<sub>2</sub>, Sar = N-methyl-glycine, GG7 underlined, with a sequence derived from <em>Escherichia coli</em> TM4, designed to bind to – and competitively disrupt – the TM4–TM4 interaction site. The peptides also contain an uncharged N-terminal sarcosine (N-methyl-glycine) tag to promote membrane insertion, and a C-terminal tri-lysine tag to direct the peptides toward the negatively-charged bacterial membrane.</p>
<p>As the lab members found that the GG7 dimerization motif was highly conserved across bacterial species, including a range of priority pathogens, the peptides were tested for interspecies inhibitory activity where they varied the SMR overexpressed in <em>E. coli</em> bacterium and the peptide. The peptides included the TM4 sequence of <em>E. coli</em>, EmrE, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, PAsmr, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, Mmr.</p>
<p>The group performed a series of assays measuring the efflux rates of the fluorescent toxin ethidium bromide, finding that the PAsmr peptide was broadly active against all SMRs expressed in <em>E. coli</em>. Interestingly, a peptide derived from <em>E. coli</em> TM4, but where the GG7 motif was scrambled, showed high activity against several SMRs.</p>
<p>Overall, the efflux inhibitors designed in this work show promise not only for improved treatment of bacterial infections, but more generally, may provide a successful approach to targeting and disrupting membrane-embedded protein–protein interactions.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/efflux_pumps_deber.jpg,,Toward a Broad-Spectrum Peptide-Based Inhibitor of Small Multidrug Resistance Efflux Pumps,"Chloe J.

Given their small size and stability, chemical synthesis would offer tremendous potential for the development of novel therapeutics. However, the accessibility of the pre-folded lasso architecture has limited this advance.</p>
<p>To better understand the folding process <em>de novo</em>, simulations are used in work published in <em>JACS</em>, by the Swanson Group to characterize the folding propensity of microcin J25, MccJ25, a lasso peptide known for its antimicrobial properties. New algorithms were developed to unambiguously distinguish threaded from nonthreaded precursors and determine handedness, a key feature in natural lasso peptides.</p>

<p>Group members found that MccJ25 indeed forms right-handed pre-lassos, in contrast to past predictions but consistent with all natural lasso peptides. Additionally, the native pre-lasso structure is shown to be metastable prior to ring formation but to readily transition to entropically favored unfolded and nonthreaded structures, suggesting that <em>de novo</em> lasso folding is rare. However, by altering the ring forming residues and appending thiol and thioester functionalities, group members were able to increase the stability of pre-lasso conformations. Furthermore, conditions leading to protonation of a histidine imidazole side chain further stabilize the modified pre-lasso ensemble.</p>
<p>This work highlights the use of computational methods to characterize lasso folding and demonstrates that <em>de novo</em> access to lasso structures can be facilitated by optimizing sequence, unnatural modifications, and reaction conditions like pH.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/swanson_jessica_figure.jpg,,Lasso Peptides: Exploring the Folding Landscape of Nature’s Smallest Interlocked Motifs,"Gabriel C.

Recent research is making it increasingly clear that the heterogeneity of amyloid deposits, extending past the commonly targeted amyloid-β, Aβ, must be considered for successful therapy. The Raskatov Research Group recently demonstrated that amyloid-α, Aα or p3, a C-terminal peptidic fragment of Aβ, aggregates rapidly to form amyloids and can expedite the aggregation of Aβ through seeding.</p>

Group members report the first cryogenic electron microscopy, cryo-EM, structure of an Aα amyloid fibril, proving unambiguously that the peptide is fibrillogenic. They demonstrate that Aα induces Aβ to form amyloid aggregates that are less toxic than pure Aβ aggregates and use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR, to provide insights into specific interactions between Aα and Aβ in solution.</p>
<p>This is the first evidence that Aα can coassemble with Aβ and alter its biological effects at relatively low concentrations.

In research published in <em>JACS</em>, members of the <a href=""https://leibniz-fmp.de/research/research-section/chemical-biology/christian-hackenberger-chemical-biology-ii"" target=""_blank"">Hackenberger Group</a> at the Humboldt University's Leibniz Research Institute, describe a powerful, simple, and highly effective strategy for the intracellular delivery of functional cargoes.</p>
<p>Previously, they have demonstrated that cell-penetrating peptide, CPP, additives equipped with electrophilic thiol-reactive moieties temporarily attach to the cellular membrane, thereby facilitating the cellular uptake of protein- and antibody-CPP cargoes through direct membrane transduction at low concentrations. Now, we hypothesize that CPP-additives with an increased retention on the cellular membrane will further enhance intracellular uptake.</p>

<p>The group members discovered that adding a small hydrophobic peptide sequence to an arginine-rich electrophilic CPP-additive further improved the uptake of protein-CPP conjugates, whereas larger hydrophobic anchors showed increased cytotoxicity. Cell viability and membrane integrity measurements, structure–activity relationship studies, and quantitative evaluation of protein-CPP uptake revealed important design principles for cell-surface-retained CPP-additives. These investigations allowed the group to identify a nontoxic, thiol-reactive CPP-additive containing the hydrophobic ILFF sequence, which can deliver fluorescent model proteins at low micromolar concentrations. This hydrophobic CPP-additive allowed the addition of protein cargoes for intracellular delivery after initial additive incubation. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and membrane tension analysis of cells treated with fluorescent ILFF-CPP-additives supported the claim of increased cell surface retention and suggested that the protein-CPP cargoes enter the cell through a mechanism involving lowered cell membrane tension.</p>

<p>Finally, group members demonstrated that their newly engineered hydrophobic CPP-additive enabled the uptake of a functional macrocyclic peptidic MDM2-inhibitor and a recombinant genome editing protein.

Schneider, Yixin Xie, and Tania L. Lopez-Silva at the National Cancer Institute, report a new positively charged azidoamino acid for strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition...","<p>Joel P. Schneider, Yixin Xie, and Tania L. Lopez-Silva at the National Cancer Institute, report a new positively charged azidoamino acid for strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, applications that overcomes possible solubility limitations of commonly used azidolysine, especially in systems with numerous ligation sites. The residue is easily synthesized, is compatible with Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis employing a range of coupling conditions, and offers efficient second-order rate constants in SPAAC ligations employing DBCO (0.34 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and BCN (0.28 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>).</p>

<p>Strain-promoted azide−alkyne cycloaddition has become a widely used tool for selective modifications of biomolecules <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> for numerous chemical biology and materials applications. This reaction is advantageous because of its chemoselectivity, reaction rates, and compatibility with aqueous physiological environments. However, the modification of peptides, proteins, and other macromolecules with azide or strained alkyne groups for SPAAC reactions can affect the macromolecule’s physical, structural, and functional properties, particularly when residues in the native primary sequence are altered or when multiple modifications are required.</p>

<p>For example, incorporating ligation handles can dramatically increase the macromolecular hydrophobicity, which affects the solubility and aggregation propensity. In some cases, organic solvents are needed to aid solubility, but at the risk of influencing the macromolecular structure.</p>

<p>A case in point is azidolysine <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K, which is commonly used to introduce an azide into peptides and proteins by solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS, often replacing a Lys residue in the native primary sequence. However, this replacement eliminates the Lys side-chain amine group that provides positive charge, which in turn facilitates solubility. Furthermore, side-chain positive charge may also be required for molecular interactions relevant to structure and function. In our own work, we experienced a problematic decrease in the solubility of peptides when <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K was incorporated at the expense of Lys. </p>

<p>One strategy to improve on commonly used SPAAC-enabling amino acids is to design unnatural residues that not only contain the necessary click chemistry handles but also functional groups that mimic those found in naturally occurring side chains. In this work, the Schneider Group designed the positively charged azido-containing amino acid 1 to address the issue of decreased macromolecule solubility that often accompanies replacment of Lys with <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silva_schneider_xin.jpg,"Tania L.

It plays a critical role in the native transportation of numerous drugs, metabolites, nutrients, and small molecules. HSA has been successfully used clinically as a noncovalent carrier for insulin, for example, Levemir, GLP-1, for example, Liraglutide, and paclitaxel, for example, Abraxane.</p>
<p>Site-specific bioconjugation strategies for HSA only would greatly expand its role as the biocompatible, non-toxic platform for theranostics purposes. Using the enabling one-bead one-compound, OBOC, technology, researchers in the Lam Group at UC Davis, as published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, generated combinatorial peptide libraries containing myristic acid, a well-known binder to HSA at Sudlow I and II binding pockets, and an acrylamide. They then used HSA as a probe to screen the OBOC myristylated peptide libraries for reactive affinity elements, RAEs, that can specifically and covalently ligate to the lysine residue at the proximity of these pockets.</p>
<p>Several RAEs have been identified and confirmed to be able to conjugate to HSA covalently. The conjugation can occur at physiological pH and proceed with a high yield within 1 h at room temperature. Tryptic peptide profiling of derivatized HSA has revealed two lysine residues, K225 and K414, as the conjugation sites, which is much more specific than the conventional lysine labeling strategy with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester.<p>
<p>The RAE-driven site-specific ligation to HSA was found to occur even in the presence of other prevalent blood proteins such as immunoglobulin or whole serum. Furthermore, these RAEs are orthogonal to the maleimide-based conjugation strategy for Cys34 of HSA. Together, these attributes make the RAEs the promising leads to further develop <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> HSA bioconjugation strategies for numerous biomedical applications.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lam_fig.jpg,,Site-Specific Albumin-Selective Ligation to Human Serum Albumin under Physiological Conditions,"Xingjian Yu, Ming Ruan, Yongheng Wang, Audrey Nguyen, Wenwu Xiao, Yousif Ajena, Lucas N.

The family consists of...","<p>The family of NF-κB transcriptional activators controls the expression of many genes, including those involved in cell survival and development. The family consists of homo- and heterodimers constituted by combinations of five subunits. Subunit p50 includes 13 tyrosine residues, but the relationship between specific tyrosine phosphorylations and p50 function is not well understood. Subunits of p50 and p65 prepared in vitro formed a heterodimer, but this NF-κB would not bind to the interleukin-2, IL-2, promoter DNA.</p>
<p>Treatment of p50 with guanosine triphosphate, GTP, and a lysate from activated Jurkat cells, effected rapid p50 phosphorylation, and, in the presence of wild-type subunit p65, was accompanied on the same time scale by IL-2 promoter DNA binding. Modified p50s containing one of seven stoichiometrically phosphorylated tyrosines in NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers, included three that facilitated binding to the IL-2 DNA promoter region to a greater extent than the wild type.</p>
<p>One of these three stoichiometrically phosphorylated p50/p65 heterodimers of NF-κB, containing pTyr60 in the p50 subunit, was treated with a lysate from activated Jurkat cells + GTP and shown to be phosphorylated on the same time scale as wild-type p50. This modified NF-κB also developed IL-2 promoter DNA binding activity on the same time scale as the wild type but exhibited greater binding to the IL-2 DNA promoters than the wild type.</p>
<p>The nature of this enhanced binding was studied in greater detail using a metabolically stable pTyr derivative at position 60 of p50 and cellular phosphatases.</p>
<p>Researchers in the Hecht group at Arizona State University, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, suggest that enhanced DNA binding of modified NF-κB containing pTyr60 in the p50 subunit may reflect stoichiometric NF-κB phosphorylation at a site that is not normally fully phosphorylated, or not phosphorylated at all, and is relatively resistant to the effects of Jurkat cell tyrosine phosphatase activity. This conclusion was reinforced by demonstrating that modification of Tyr60 of p50 with a metabolically stable methylenephosphonate moiety further increased the stability of the formed NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer against the action of activated Jurkat cell phosphatases.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hecht_figure.jpg,,Site-Selective Tyrosine Phosphorylation in the Activation of the p50 Subunit of NF-κB for DNA Binding and Transcription,"Shengxi Chen, Xun Ji, Larisa M.

Protein–protein interactions involving PKC and its scaffolding partners dictate the spatiotemporal dynamics of PKC activity, including its access to activating second messenger molecules and potential substrates.</p>
<p>While the A Kinase Anchoring Protein (AKAP) family of scaffold proteins universally bind PKA, several were also found to scaffold PKC, thereby serving to tune its catalytic output. Targeting these scaffolding interactions can further shed light on the effect of subcellular compartmentalization on PKC signaling.</p>
<p>Here is reported the development of two hydrocarbon stapled peptides, CSTAD5 and CSTAD6, that are cell permeable and bind PKC to disrupt PKC–gravin complex formation in cells. Both constrained peptides downregulate PMA-induced cytoskeletal remodeling that is mediated by the PKC–gravin complex as measured by cell rounding.</p>
<p>Further, these peptides downregulate PKC substrate phosphorylation and cell motility. The researchers suspect that no PKC-selective AKAP disruptors have previously been reported and thus CSTAD5 and CSTAD6 are novel disruptors of PKC scaffolding by AKAPs and may serve as powerful tools for dissecting AKAP-localized PKC signaling.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kennedy-RSC-e1632923162260.jpg,,Targeted disruption of PKC from AKAP signaling complexes.,"Limaye AJ, Bendzunas GN, Kennedy EJ.",RSC Chem Biol. 2021 Jul 19;2(4):1227-1231.,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cb/d1cb00106j,,,,,,,,pkc-disruptors,11/30/24 16:38

However, synthesis and characterization of receptors for an array remain a bottleneck in the field.</p>
<p>Receptor discovery has been streamlined using dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs), but the resulting receptors have primarily been utilized in isolation rather than as part of the entire library, with only a few examples that make use of the complexity of a library of receptors.</p>
<p>Herein researchers demonstrated a unique sensor array approach using “imprint-and-report” DCLs that obviates the need for receptor synthesis and isolation. This strategy leverages information stored in DCLs in the form of differential library speciation to provide a high-throughput method for both developing a sensor array and analyzing data for analyte differentiation.</p>
<p>First, each DCL is templated with analyte to give an imprinted library, followed by in situ fluorescent indicator displacement analysis. They further demonstrate that the reverse strategy, imprinting with the fluorescent reporter followed by displacement with each analyte, provides a more sensitive method for differentiating analytes. </p>
<p>They describe the development of this differential sensing system using the methylated Arg and Lys post-translational modifications (PTMs). Altogether, 19 combinations of 3–5 DCL data sets that discriminate all 7 PTMs were identified. Thus, a comparable sensor array workflow results in a larger payoff due to the immense information stored within multiple noncovalent networks.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Waters-JACS-e1632920525759.jpg,,Development of “Imprint-and-Report” Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries for Differential Sensing Applications,"Harrison, E.

Significantly, Cts L has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19 due to its recently unveiled critical role in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. However, there are currently no clinically approved specific inhibitors of Cts L, as it is often challenging to obtain specificity against the many highly homologous cathepsin family cysteine proteases. </p>
<p>Peptide-based agents are often promising protease inhibitors as they offer high selectivity and potency, but unfortunately are subject to degradation in vivo. Thioamide substitution, a single-atom O-to-S modification in the peptide backbone, has been shown to improve the proteolytic stability of peptides addressing this issue.</p>
<p>Utilizing this approach, researchers in the Petersson lab demonstrate that good peptidyl substrates can be converted into sub-micromolar inhibitors of Cts L by a single thioamide substitution in the peptide backbone. They have designed and scanned several thioamide stabilized peptide scaffolds, in which one peptide, RS1A, was stabilized against proteolysis by all five cathepsins (Cts L, Cts V, Cts K, Cts S, and Cts B) while inhibiting Cts L with >25-fold specificity against the other cathepsins.</p>
<p> They further showed that this stabilized RS1A peptide could inhibit Cts L in human liver carcinoma lysates (IC50 = 19 μM).

The resultant topography class, termed the rippled β-sheet, was introduced as a theoretical concept by Pauling and Corey in 1953.</p>
<p>Unlike other fundamental protein structural motifs identified around that time, including the α-helix and the pleated β-sheet, it took several decades before conclusive experimental data supporting the proposed rippled β-sheet motif were gained.</p>
<p>Much of the key experimental evidence was provided over the course of the past decade through the concurrent efforts of the Raskatov, Schneider, and Nilsson laboratories. Studies that focused on developing new self-assembling hydrogel materials have shown that certain amphiphilic peptides form fibrils and hydrogel networks that are more rigid and have a higher thermodynamic stability when made from racemic peptide mixtures as opposed to pure enantiomers.</p>
<p>Related interrogation of assemblies composed of mixtures of l- and d-amphiphilic peptides confirmed that the resulting fibrils were composed of alternating l/d peptides consistent with rippled β-sheets. </p>
<p>It was also demonstrated that mirror-image amyloid beta (Aβ) could act as a molecular chaperone to promote oligomer-to-fibril conversion of the natural Aβ enantiomer, which was found to reduce Aβ neurotoxicity against different neuronal cell models. </p>
<p>With a cross-disciplinary approach that combines experiment and theory, these three laboratories have demonstrated the unique biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties that arise upon mixing of peptide enantiomers, in consequence of rippled β-sheet formation.</p>
<p> In this Account, the authors give an overview of the early history of the rippled β-sheet and provide a detailed structural description/definition of this motif relative to the pleated β-sheet. They then summarize the key findings, obtained on three unique sets of aggregating mirror-image peptide pairs through independent efforts of our three laboratories, and use these results to delineate the landscape of the rippled β-sheet structural motif to inspire future studies.</p>
<p> Peptide sequence parameters that favor rippled β-sheet assembly are described, along with the accompanying kinetic and thermodynamic properties, as well as the resulting emergent physical properties of the assemblies.</p>
<p>The Account then concludes with a brief overview of some key unresolved challenges in this nascent field. There is much potential for future applications of this unique supramolecular motif in the realm of materials design and biomedical research. They hope this Account will stimulate much-needed discussion of this fascinating structural class to eventually produce a fully quantitative, rational framework for the molecular engineering of rippled β-sheets in the future.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nilsson-e1624203736520.jpg,,Defining the Landscape of the Pauling-Corey Rippled Sheet: An Orphaned Motif Finding New Homes,"Jevgenij A.

<p>The ability of lytic peptides to engage with cell membranes has been exploited for drug delivery to carry impermeable cargo into cells, but their inherent toxicity results in narrow therapeutic windows that limit their clinical translation. For most linear MLPs, a prerequisite for membrane activity is their folding at cell surfaces. Modification of their backbone with N-methyl amides inhibits folding, which directly correlates to a reduction in lytic potential but only minimally affects cell entry. <p/>
<p>Researchers in Joel Schneider's lab synthesized a library of N-methylated peptides derived from MLPs and conducted structure–activity studies that demonstrated the broad utility of this approach across different secondary structures, including both β-sheet and helix-forming peptides.

In particular, CIB1 depletion significantly impairs tumor growth in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, CIB1 is a potentially attractive target for cancer chemotherapy that has yet to be validated by a chemical probe. To produce a probe molecule to the CIB1 helix 10 (H10) pocket and demonstrate that it is a viable target for molecular intervention, the researchers employed random peptide phage display to screen and select CIB1-binding peptides. The top peptide sequence selected, UNC10245092, was produced synthetically, and binding to CIB1 was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. Both assays showed that the peptide bound to CIB1 with low nanomolar affinity. CIB1 was cocrystallized with UNC10245092, and the 2.1 Å resolution structure revealed that the peptide binds as an α-helix in the H10 pocket, displacing the CIB1 C-terminal H10 helix and causing conformational changes in H7 and H8. UNC10245092 was further derivatized with a C-terminal Tat-derived cell penetrating peptide (CPP) to demonstrate its effects on TNBC cells in culture, which are consistent with results of CIB1 depletion.

One strategy to improve the production is to combine a recombinant production system with native enzyme-mediated cyclization. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) are enzymes that can act as peptide ligases in certain plants to facilitate cyclotide maturation. One of these ligases, OaAEP1b, originates from the cyclotide-producing plant, <em>Oldenlandia affinis</em>, and can be produced recombinantly for use <em>in vitro</em> as an alternative to chemical cyclization of recombinant substrates.

<p>In this work, researchers in the Liu lab demonstrate for the first time, that poly(2-oxazoline)(POX) can work as a functional mimic of peptides. POX-based glycine pseudopeptides, a host defense peptide mimic, had potent activities against methicillin-resistant <em> S. aureus</em>, which causes formidable infections. The POX mimic showed potent activity against persisters that are highly resistant to antibiotics. <em> S. aureus </em> did not develop resistance to POX owning to the reactive oxygen species related antimicrobial mechanism. POX-treated <em> S. aureus </em> is sensitive to common antibiotics, demonstrating no observable antimicrobial pressure or cross-resistance in using antimicrobial POX. <p/>

<p>Droplets of liquid water stably reside at the interface of the silicone oil and perfluoro oilm 1.6658 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.

The droplets with and without Snomax froze at different temperatures and separated into two groups in their system. The researchers employed the screening system to test samples that have different ice-nucleating activities.</p>
